The news comes from a company by name RocketStar Inc. which announced in a press release that they have “reinvented” spacecraft by releasing the “world’s first fusion-enhanced space thruster, the FireStar™ Fusion Drive.  They claim that the FireStar TM Fusion Drive improves their water powered pulsed plasma thruster by harnessing aneutronic nuclear fusion by 50%.  In this video I explain what this all means.\n\n🤓 Check out my new quiz app ➜  http://quizwithit.com/\n💌 Support me on Donorbox ➜ https://donorbox.org/swtg\n📝 Transcripts and written news on Substack ➜ https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n👉 Transcript with links to references on Patreon ➜ https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n📩 Free weekly science newsletter  ➜ https://sabinehossenfelder.com/newsletter/\n👂 Audio only podcast ➜  https://open.spotify.com/show/0MkNfXlKnMPEUMEeKQYmYC\n🔗 Join this channel to get access to perks ➜\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1yNl2E66ZzKApQdRuTQ4tw/join\n🖼️ On instagram ➜ https://www.instagram.com/sciencewtg/\n\n#science #sciencenews #technews #technews #space #nuclear",

At least that’s what some physicists think. Others say this is just a wrong interpretation of what is really going on. This debate has been going on for a century, but a new experiment could finally end the debate once and for all. Let’s have a look.\n\nPaper: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adl6078\n\n🤓 Check out my new quiz app ➜  http://quizwithit.com/\n💌 Support me on Donorbox ➜ https://donorbox.org/swtg\n📝 Transcripts and written news on Substack ➜ https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n👉 Transcript with links to references on Patreon ➜ https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n📩 Free weekly science newsletter  ➜ https://sabinehossenfelder.com/newsletter/\n👂 Audio only podcast ➜  https://open.spotify.com/show/0MkNfXlKnMPEUMEeKQYmYC\n🔗 Join this channel to get access to perks ➜\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1yNl2E66ZzKApQdRuTQ4tw/join\n🖼️ On instagram ➜ https://www.instagram.com/sciencewtg/\n\n#science #sciencenews #physics",
