It&#8217;s impossible to explain everything we&#8217;re doing while it&#8217;s happening.  But I want to record some of our work.  So please pardon how I skim through a bunch of already known ideas in my desperate attempt to quickly reach the main point.  I&#8217;ll try to make up for this by giving lots of references.</p>\n<p>Today I&#8217;ll talk about an interesting class of models we have developed together with Sean Wu.  We call them &#8216;stochastic <i>C</i>-set rewriting systems&#8217;.  They&#8217;re just part of our overall framework, but they&#8217;re an important part.</p>\n<p>In this sort of model time is continuous, the state of the world is described by discrete data, and the state changes stochastically at discrete moments in time.   All <i>those</i> features are already present in the class of models I described in <a href=\"https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2024/02/28/agent-based-models-part-7/\">Part 7</a>.  But today&#8217;s models are far more general, because the state of the world is described in a more general way!   Now the state of the world at any moment of time is a <b><i>C</i>-set</b>: a functor</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Ccolon+C+%5Cto+%5Cmathsf%7BSet%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Ccolon+C+%5Cto+%5Cmathsf%7BSet%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Ccolon+C+%5Cto+%5Cmathsf%7BSet%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"f &#92;colon C &#92;to &#92;mathsf{Set} \" class=\"latex\" />\n</div>\n<p>for some fixed finitely presented category <i>C</i> to the category of sets.</p>\n<p><i>C</i>-sets are a flexible generalization of directed graphs.

We plan to take advantage of all this stuff!</p>\n<p>In particular, we&#8217;ll use &#8216;double pushout rewriting&#8217; to specify rules for how a <i>C</i>-set can change with time.

This is a way of letting rewrite rules have a probability &lt; 1 of ever being applied.  If you don&#039;t like these features you can easily limit the formalism to avoid them.</p>\n<p>The more serious subtleties involve whether and how to change wait times as the state of the world changes.  For example, we can imagine more general timers that explicitly depend on the current state of the world as well as the time <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%5Cin+%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%5Cin+%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%5Cin+%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"t &#92;in [0,&#92;infty).\" class=\"latex\" />  However, in this case I am confused about how we should update our table of wait times as the state of the world changes.   So I decided to postpone discussing this generalization!</p>\n",

Roughly speaking, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeycomb_(geometry)\">honeycomb</a> is a way of filling 3d space with polyhedra.   The most symmetrical honeycombs are the &#8216;regular&#8217; ones.     For any honeycomb, we define a <b>flag</b> to be a chosen vertex lying on a chosen edge lying on a chosen face lying on a chosen polyhedron.  A honeycomb is <b>regular</b> if its geometrical symmetries act transitively on flags.</p>\n<p>The most familiar regular honeycomb is the usual way of filling Euclidean space with cubes.  This <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_honeycomb\">cubic honeycomb</a> is denoted by the symbol {4,3,4}, because a square has 4 edges, 3 squares meet at each corner of a cube, and 4 cubes meet along each edge of this honeycomb.   We can also define regular honeycombs in hyperbolic space.   For example, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order-5_cubic_honeycomb\">order-5 cubic honeycomb</a> is a hyperbolic honeycomb denoted {4,3,5}, since 5 cubes meet along each edge:</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order-5_cubic_honeycomb\"><br />\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/H3_435_CC_center.png\" width=\"450\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n</a>\n</div>\n<p>Coxeter showed there are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeycomb_(geometry)#Hyperbolic_honeycombs\">15 regular hyperbolic honeycombs</a>. The hexagonal tiling honeycomb is one of these.  But it does not contain polyhedra of the usual sort!  Instead, it contains flat Euclidean planes embedded in hyperbolic space, each plane containing the vertices of infinitely many regular hexagons.  You can think of such a sheet of hexagons as a generalized polyhedron with <i>infinitely many</i> faces.  You can see a bunch of such sheets in the picture:</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:H3_633_FC_boundary.png\"><br />\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/{6,3,3}_honeycomb_roice_bright.png\" width=\"450\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n</a>\n</div>\n<p>The symbol for the hexagonal tiling honeycomb is {6,3,3}, because a hexagon has 6 edges, 3 hexagons meet at each corner in a plane tiled by regular hexagons, and 3 such planes meet along each edge of this honeycomb.  You can see that too if you look carefully.</p>\n<p>A flat Euclidean plane in hyperbolic space is called a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horosphere\">horosphere</a>.  Here&#8217;s a picture of a horosphere tiled with regular hexagons, yet again drawn by Roice:</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horosphere\"><br />\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/{6,3,3}_honeycomb_one_cell_horosphere.png\" width=\"450\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n</a>\n</div>\n<p>Unlike the previous pictures, which are views from inside hyperbolic space, this uses the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_space#Models_of_hyperbolic_space\">Poincar&eacute; ball model</a> of hyperbolic space. As you can see here, a horosphere is a limiting case of a sphere in hyperbolic space, where one point of the sphere has become a &#8216;point at infinity&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Be careful. A horosphere is <em>intrinsically</em> flat, so if you draw regular hexagons on it their internal angles are</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Cpi%2F3+%3D+120%5E%5Ccirc&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Cpi%2F3+%3D+120%5E%5Ccirc&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Cpi%2F3+%3D+120%5E%5Ccirc&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"2&#92;pi/3 = 120^&#92;circ\" class=\"latex\" />\n</div>\n<p>as usual in Euclidean geometry.  But a horosphere is not &#8216;totally geodesic&#8217;: straight lines in the horosphere are not geodesics in hyperbolic space!  Thus, a hexagon in hyperbolic space with the same vertices as one of the hexagons in the horosphere actually bulges out from the horosphere a bit &#8212; and its internal angles are less than <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Cpi%2F3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Cpi%2F3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Cpi%2F3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"2&#92;pi/3\" class=\"latex\" />: they are</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carccos%5Cleft%28-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D%5Cright%29+%5Capprox+109.47%5E%5Ccirc+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carccos%5Cleft%28-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D%5Cright%29+%5Capprox+109.47%5E%5Ccirc+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carccos%5Cleft%28-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D%5Cright%29+%5Capprox+109.47%5E%5Ccirc+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"&#92;arccos&#92;left(-&#92;frac{1}{3}&#92;right) &#92;approx 109.47^&#92;circ \" class=\"latex\" />\n</div>\n<p>This angle may be familar if you&#8217;ve studied tetrahedra.  That&#8217;s because each vertex lies at the center of a regular tetrahedron, with its four nearest neighbors forming the tetrahedron&#8217;s corners.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s really these hexagons in hyperbolic space that are faces of the hexagonal tiling honeycomb, not those tiling the horospheres, though perhaps you can barely see the difference.  This can be quite confusing until you think about a simpler example, like the difference between a cube in Euclidean 3-space and a cube drawn on a sphere in Euclidean space.</p>\n<h3> Connection to special relativity </h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s an interesting connection between hyperbolic space, special relativity, and 2&times;2 matrices.

In these models, the probability per time of an agent making a transition and leaving some state can depend on when it arrived at that state.  It can also depend on which agents are in other states that are &#8216;linked&#8217; to that edge&#8212;and when <i>those</i> agents arrived.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to generalize this framework to handle processes where agents are born or die&#8212;or perhaps more generally, processes where some number of agents turn into some other number of agents.   There&#8217;s already a framework that does something sort of like this.  It&#8217;s called &#8216;stochastic Petri nets&#8217;, and we explained this framework here:</p>\n<p>&bull; John Baez and Jacob Biamonte, <i><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3632\">Quantum Techniques for Stochastic Mechanics</a></i>, World Scientific Press, Singapore, 2018.  (See also blog articles <a href=\"https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/#petri\">here</a>.)</p>\n<p>However, in their simplest form, stochastic Petri nets are designed for agents whose only distinguishing information is which state they&#8217;re in.  They don&#8217;t have &#8216;names&#8217;&#8212;that is, individual identities.  Thus, even calling them &#8216;agents&#8217; is a bit of a stretch: usually they&#8217;re called &#8216;tokens&#8217;, since they&#8217;re drawn as black dots.</p>\n<p>We could try to enhance the Petri net framework to give tokens names and other identifying features.  There are various imaginable ways to do this, such as &#8216;colored Petri nets&#8217;.  But so far this approach seems rather ill-adapted for processes where agents have identities&#8212;perhaps because I&#8217;m not thinking about the problem the right way.</p>\n<p>So, at some point I decided to try something less ambitious.  It turns out that in applications to epidemiology, general processes where <i>n</i> agents come in and <i>m</i> go out are not often required.  So I&#8217;ve been trying to minimally enhance the framework from last time to include processes &#8216;birth&#8217; and &#8216;death&#8217; processes as well as transitions from state to state.</p>\n<p>As I thought about this, some questions kept plaguing me:</p>\n<p>When an agent gets created, or &#8216;born&#8217;, which one actually gets born?   In other words, what is its name?   Its precise name may not matter, but if we want to keep track of it after it&#8217;s born, we need to give it a name.  And this name had better be &#8216;fresh&#8217;: not already the name of some other agent.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also the question of what happens when an agent gets destroyed, or &#8216;dies&#8217;.  This feels less difficult: there just stops being an agent with the given name.  But probably we want to prevent a new agent from having the same name as that dead agent.</p>\n<p>Both these questions seem fairly simple, but so far they&#8217;re making it hard for me to invent a truly elegant framework.  At first I tried to separately describe transitions between states, births, and deaths.  But this seemed to triplicate the amount of work I needed to do.</p>\n<p>Then I tried models that have</p>\n<p>&bull; a finite set <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"S\" class=\"latex\" /> of <strong>states</strong>,</p>\n<p>&bull; a finite set <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"T\" class=\"latex\" /> of <strong>transitions</strong>,</p>\n<p>&bull; maps <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%2C+d+%5Ccolon+T+%5Cto+S+%2B+%5C%7B%5Ctextrm%7Bundefined%7D%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%2C+d+%5Ccolon+T+%5Cto+S+%2B+%5C%7B%5Ctextrm%7Bundefined%7D%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%2C+d+%5Ccolon+T+%5Cto+S+%2B+%5C%7B%5Ctextrm%7Bundefined%7D%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"u, d &#92;colon T &#92;to S + &#92;{&#92;textrm{undefined}&#92;}\" class=\"latex\" /> mapping each transition to its <strong>upstream</strong> and <strong>downstream</strong> states.</p>\n<p>Here <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%2B+%5C%7B%5Ctextrm%7Bundefined%7D%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%2B+%5C%7B%5Ctextrm%7Bundefined%7D%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%2B+%5C%7B%5Ctextrm%7Bundefined%7D%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"S + &#92;{&#92;textrm{undefined}&#92;}\" class=\"latex\" /> is the disjoint union of <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"S\" class=\"latex\" /> and a singleton whose one element is called <strong>undefined</strong>.

In practice most of transitions will be of this sort.</p>\n<p>4) We never need transitions whose upstream and downstream are undefined: these would describe agents that pop into existence and instantly disappear.</p>\n<p>This is sort of nice, except for the fourth case.  Unfortunately when I go ahead and try to actually describe a model based on this paradigm, I seem still to wind up needing to handle births, deaths and transformations quite differently.</p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2024/02/28/agent-based-models-part-7/\">last time</a> my models had a fixed set <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"A\" class=\"latex\" /> of <strong>agents</strong>.  To handle births and deaths, I wanted to make this set time-dependent.  But I need to separately say how this works for transformations, birth transitions and death transitions.  For transformations we don&#8217;t change <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"A.\" class=\"latex\" />  For birth transitions we add a new element to <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"A.\" class=\"latex\" />  And for death transitions we remove an element from <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"A,\" class=\"latex\" /> and maybe record its name on a ledger or drive a stake through its heart to make sure it can never be born again!</p>\n<p>So far this is tolerable, but things get worse.  Our model also needs &#8216;links&#8217; from states to transitions, to say how agents present in those states affect the timing of those transition. These are used in the &#8216;jump function&#8217;, a stochastic function that answers this question:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  If at time <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"t\" class=\"latex\" /> agent <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"a\" class=\"latex\" /> arrives at the state upstream to some transition <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"e,\" class=\"latex\" /> and the agents at states linked to the transition <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"e\" class=\"latex\" /> form some set <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_e%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_e%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_e%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"S_e,\" class=\"latex\" /> when will agent <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"a\" class=\"latex\" /> make the transition <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"e\" class=\"latex\" /> given that it doesn&#8217;t do anything else first?\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This works fine for transformations, meaning transitions <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"e\" class=\"latex\" /> that have both an upstream and downstream state.  It works just a tiny bit differently for death transitions.   But birth transitions are quite different: since newly born agents don&#8217;t have a previous upstream state <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%28e%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%28e%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%28e%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"u(e)\" class=\"latex\" />, they don&#8217;t have a time at which they arrived at that state.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this is just how modeling works: perhaps the search for a staggeringly beautiful framework is a distraction.  But another approach just occurred to me.  Today I just want to briefly state it.  I don&#8217;t want to write a full blog article on it yet, since I&#8217;ve already spent a lot of time writing two articles that I deleted when I became disgusted with them&#8212;and I might become disgusted with this approach too!</p>\n<p>Briefly, this approach is exactly the approach I described <a href=\"https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2024/02/28/agent-based-models-part-7/\">last time</a>.  There are fundamentally no births and no deaths: all transitions have an upstream and a downstream state.  There is a fixed set <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"A\" class=\"latex\" /> of agents that does not change with time.   We handle births and deaths using a dirty trick.</p>\n<p>Namely, births are transitions out of a &#8216;unborn&#8217; state.  Agents hang around in this state until they are born.</p>\n<p>Similarly, deaths are transitions to a &#8216;dead&#8217; state.</p>\n<p>There can be multiple &#8216;unborn&#8217; states and &#8216;dead&#8217; states.  Having multiple unborn states makes it easy to have agents with different characteristics enter the model.  Having multiple dead states makes it easy for us to keep tallies of different causes of death.  We should make the unborn states distinct from the dead states to prevent  &#8216;reincarnation&#8217;&#8212;that is, the birth of a new agent that happens to equal an agent that previously died.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m hoping that when we proceed this way, we can shoehorn birth and death processes into the framework described last time, without really needing to modify it at all!  All we&#8217;re doing is exploiting it in a new way.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s one possible problem: if we start with a finite number of agents in the &#8216;unborn&#8217; states, the population of agents can&#8217;t grow indefinitely!   But this doesn&#8217;t seem very dire.  For most agent-based models we don&#8217;t feel a need to let the number of agents grow arbitrarily large.  Or we can relax the requirement that the set of agents is finite, and put an infinite number of agents <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_1%2C+u_2%2C+u_3%2C+%5Cdots&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_1%2C+u_2%2C+u_3%2C+%5Cdots&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_1%2C+u_2%2C+u_3%2C+%5Cdots&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"u_1, u_2, u_3, &#92;dots\" class=\"latex\" /> in an unborn state.  This can be done without using an infinite amount of memory: it&#8217;s a &#8216;potential infinity&#8217; rather than an &#8216;actual infinity&#8217;.</p>\n<p>There could be other problems.  So I&#8217;ll post this now before I think of them.</p>\n",

It lasts a very short time before they annihilate each other.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bit like a hydrogen atom where the electron has been replaced with an antiproton!  But it&#8217;s much smaller than a hydrogen atom.  And unlike a hydrogen atom, which is held together by the electric force, protonium is mainly held together by the strong nuclear force.</p>\n<p>There are various ways to make protonium.  One is to make a bunch of antiprotons and mix them with protons.  This was done <em>accidentally</em> in 2002.  They only realized this upon carefully analyzing the data 4 years later.</p>\n<p>This time, people were studying the decay of the J/psi particle.  The J/psi is made of a heavy quark and its antiparticle.  It&#8217;s 3.3 times as heavy as a proton, so it&#8217;s theoretically able to decay into protonium.  And careful study showed that yes, it does this sometimes!</p>\n<p>The new paper on this has a rather dry title&#8212;not &#8220;We found protonium!&#8221;  But it has over 550 authors, which hints that it&#8217;s a big deal.  I won&#8217;t list them.</p>\n<p>• BESIII Collaboration, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17937\">Observation of the anomalous shape of X(1840) in J/ψ→γ3(π+π−)</a>, <i>Phys. Rev. Lett.</i> <b>132</b> (2024), 151901.</p>\n<p>The idea here is that sometimes the J/ψ particle decays into a gamma ray and 3 pion-antipion pairs.  When they examined this decay, they found evidence that an intermediate step involved a particle of mass 1880 MeV/c², a bit more than an already known intermediate of mass 1840 MeV/c².</p>\n<p>This new particle is a bit lighter than twice the mass of a proton, 938 MeV/c².  So, there&#8217;s a good chance that it&#8217;s protonium!</p>\n<p>But how did physicists made protonium by accident in 2002?   They were trying to make <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihydrogen\">antihydrogen</a>, which is a positron orbiting an antiproton.  To do this, they used the Antiproton Decelerator at CERN.  This is just one of the many cool gadgets they keep near the Swiss-French border.</p>\n<p>You see, to create antiprotons you need to smash particles at each other at almost the speed of light&mdash;so the antiprotons usually shoot out really fast.  It takes serious cleverness to slow them down and catch them without letting them bump into matter and annihilate.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what the Antiproton Decelerator does. So they created a bunch of antiprotons and slowed them down.  Once they managed to do this, they caught the antiprotons in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penning_trap\">Penning trap</a>.  This holds charged particles using magnetic and electric fields.  Then they cooled the antiprotons&mdash;slowed them even more&mdash;by letting them interact with a cold gas of electrons.  Then they mixed in some positrons.  And they got antihydrogen!</p>\n<p>But apparently some protons got in there too, so they also made some protonium, by accident.  They only realized this when they carefully analyzed the data 4 years later, in a paper with only a few authors:</p>\n<p>&bull; N. Zurlo, M. Amoretti, C. Amsler, G. Bonomi, C. Carraro, C. L.

Yamazaki, <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.3193\">Production of slow protonium in vacuum</a>, <i>Hyperfine Interactions</i> <b>172</b> (2006), 97&ndash;105.</p>\n<p>Protonium is sometimes called an &#8216;exotic atom&#8217;&mdash;though personally I&#8217;d consider it an exotic nucleus.  The child in me thinks it&#8217;s really cool that there&#8217;s an abbreviation for protonium, Pn, just like a normal element.</p>\n",

At least that&#8217;s what a lot of astronomers think.  So examine the sky between Arcturus and Vega now&#8212;and look again if you hear this event has happened.  Normally this star is magnitude 10, too dim to see.   When it goes nova is should reach magnitude 2 for a week&#8212;as bright as the North Star.  So you will see a new star, which is the original meaning of &#8216;nova&#8217;.</p>\n<p>But why do they think T Corona Borealis will go nova this year?  How could they possibly know that?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s done this before.  It&#8217;s a binary star with a white dwarf orbiting a red giant.  The red giant is spewing out gas.  The much denser white dwarf collects some of this gas on its surface until there&#8217;s enough fuel to cause a runaway thermonuclear reaction&#8212;a nova!</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve seen it happen twice.   T Corona Borealis went nova on May 12, 1866 and again on February 9, 1946.   What&#8217;s happening now is a lot like what happened in 1946.</p>\n<p>In February 2015, there was a sustained brightening of T Corona Borealis: it went from magnitude 10.5 to about 9.2.   The same thing happened eight years before it went nova the last time.</p>\n<p>In June 2018, the star dimmed slightly but still remained at an unusually high level of activity.  Then in April 2023 it dimmed to magnitude 12.3.  The same thing happened one year before it went nova the last time.</p>\n<p>If this pattern continues, T Corona Borealis should erupt sometime between now and September 2024.   I&#8217;m not completely confident that it will follow the same pattern!   But we can just wait and see.</p>\n<p>This is one of only 5 known repeating novas in the Milky Way, so we&#8217;re lucky to have this chance.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how it might work:</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img width=\"450\" src=\"https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/nova.gif\" />\n</div>\n<p>The description at <a href=\"https://blogs.nasa.gov/Watch_the_Skies/2024/02/27/view-nova-explosion-new-star-in-northern-crown/\">NASA&#8217;s blog</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  A red giant star and white dwarf orbit each other in this animation of a nova. The red giant is a large sphere in shades of red, orange, and white, with the side facing the white dwarf the lightest shades. The white dwarf is hidden in a bright glow of white and yellows, which represent an accretion disk around the star. A stream of material, shown as a diffuse cloud of red, flows from the red giant to the white dwarf. The animation opens with the red giant on the right side of the screen, co-orbiting the white dwarf. When the red giant moves behind the white dwarf, a nova explosion on the white dwarf ignites, filling the screen with white light. After the light fades, a ball of ejected nova material is shown in pale orange. A small white spot remains after the fog of material clears, indicating that the white dwarf has survived the explosion.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>For more details, try this:</p>\n<p>&bull;  B. E.

There are many ways to make this question precise&#8230; but it remains a bit mysterious.   The best results I know appear, not in a published paper, but on MathOverflow!</p>\n<p>In 1998, the Fields-medal winning topologist <a href=\"https://eudml.org/doc/224467\">Michael Freedman</a> conjectured that the fraction of statements that are provable in Peano Arithmetic approaches zero quite rapidly as you go to longer and longer statements:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img width=\"450\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/unprovability_michael_freedman.png\" />\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He must also have been conjecturing that Peano Arithmetic is consistent, since if it&#8217;s inconsistent then <i>all</i> its statements are provable.  From now on let&#8217;s assume that PA is consistent.</p>\n<p>In 2005, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aam.2004.10.003\">Cristian Calude and Konrad Jürgensen</a> published a paper arguing that Freedman was on the right track.   More precisely, they showed that the fraction of statements in PA that are provable goes to zero as we go to longer and longer statements.    The fraction of disprovable statements also goes to zero.  So, the fraction of undecidable statements approaches 1.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately their paper had a mistake!</p>\n<p>In 2009, <a href=\"https://mathoverflow.net/a/7902/2893\">David Speyer</a> argued that the fraction of provable statements does not approach 0 and does not approach 1 as we consider longer and longer statements.   Instead, it&#8217;s bounded by numbers between 0 and 1.  Similarly for the fraction of undecidable statements!   His argument is not air-tight, as he admits and explains&#8212;but I believe it.   Someone should try to complete his proof.</p>\n<p>Speyer&#8217;s idea is very simple: if P is any statement, the statement &#8220;P or 1 = 1&#8221; is provable.  This can be used to get a lower bound on the number of provable statements of a given length.  Similarly, suppose G is some undecidable statement.  Then for any statement P, the statement &#8220;G and (P or 1 = 1)&#8221; is undecidable.   This can be used to get a lower bound on the number of undecidable statements of a given length.</p>\n",

In classical logic it is.

When the Puritans took over England, they burned not only witches and heretics, but also books &mdash; and music!  They hated the complex polyphonic choral music of the Catholics.</p>\n<p>So, in the history of British music, between the great polyphonists <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fayrfax\">Robert Fayrfax</a> (1465-1521) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Taverner\">John Taverner</a> (1490-1545), there was a kind of gap &mdash; a silence &mdash; until the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peterhouse_partbooks\">Peterhouse Partbooks</a> were rediscovered.</p>\n<p>These were an extensive collection of musical manuscripts, handwritten by a single scribe between 1539 and 1541.  Most of them got lost somehow and found only in the 1850s.  Others were found even later, in 1926! They were hidden behind a panel in a library &mdash; probably hidden from the Puritans.</p>\n<p>The 1850 batch contains wonderful compositions by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Ludford\">Nicholas Ludford</a><br />\n(~1485-1557).

			"itemContent": "<p><a href=\"https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2024/02/21/agent-based-models-part-6/\">Last time</a> I presented a simple, limited class of agent-based models where each agent independently hops around a graph.  I wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Today the probability for an agent to hop from one vertex of the graph to another by going along some edge will be determined the moment the agent arrives at that vertex.  It will depend only on the agent and the various edges leaving that vertex.  Later I&#8217;ll want this probability to depend on other things too&#8212;like whether other agents are at some vertex or other.  When we do that, we&#8217;ll need to keep updating this probability as the other agents move around.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Let me try to figure out that generalization now.</p>\n<p>Last time I discovered something surprising to me.  To describe it, let&#8217;s bring in some jargon.  The conditional probability per time of an agent making a transition from its current state to a chosen other state (given that it doesn&#8217;t make some <em>other</em> transition) is called the <strong>hazard function</strong> of that transition.   In a <strong>Markov process</strong>, the hazard function is actually a constant, independent of how long the agent has been in its current state.  In a <strong>semi-Markov process</strong>, the hazard function is a function only of how long the agent has been in its current state.</p>\n<p>For example, people like to describe radioactive decay using a Markov process, since experimentally it doesn&#8217;t seem that &#8216;old&#8217; radioactive atoms decay at a higher or lower rate than &#8216;young&#8217; ones.  (Quantum theory says this can&#8217;t be exactly true, but nobody has seen deviations yet.)  On the other hand, the death rate of people is highly non-Markovian, but we might try to describe it using a semi-Markov process.  Shortly after birth it&#8217;s high&#8212;that&#8217;s called &#8216;infant mortality&#8217;.  Then it goes down, and then it gradually increases.</p>\n<p>We definitely want to our agent-based processes to have the ability to describe semi-Markov processes.  What surprised me last time is that I could do it without explicitly keeping track of how long the agent has been in its current state, or when it entered its current state!</p>\n<p>The reason is that we can decide which state an agent will transition to next, and when, as soon as it enters its current state.  This decision is random, of course.  But using random number generators we can make this decision the moment the agent enters the given state&#8212;because there is nothing more to be learned by waiting!  I described an algorithm for doing this.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure this is well-known, but I had fun rediscovering it.</p>\n<p>But today I want to allow the hazard function for a given agent to make a given transition to depend on the states of other agents.  In this case, if some <em>other</em> agent randomly changes state, we will need to recompute <em>our</em> agent&#8217;s hazard function.  There is probably no computationally feasible way to avoid this, in general.  In some analytically solvable models there might be&#8212;but we&#8217;re simulating systems precisely because we don&#8217;t know how to solve them analytically.</p>\n<p>So now we&#8217;ll want to keep track of the <strong>residence time</strong> of each agent&#8212;that is, how long it&#8217;s been in its current state.  But William Waites pointed out a clever way to do this: it&#8217;s cheaper to keep track of the agent&#8217;s <strong>arrival time</strong>, i.e. when it entered its current state.  This way you don&#8217;t need to keep updating the residence time.  Whenever you need to know the residence time, you can just subtract the arrival time from the current clock time.</p>\n<p>Even more importantly, our model should now have &#8216;informational links&#8217; from states to transitions.  If we want the presence or absence of agents in some state to affect the hazard function of some transition, we should draw a &#8216;link&#8217; from that state to that transition!   Of course you could say that anything is allowed to affect anything else.  But this would create an undisciplined mess where you can&#8217;t keep track of the chains of causation.   So we want to see explicit &#8216;links&#8217;.</p>\n<p>So, here&#8217;s my new modeling approach, which generalizes the one we saw last time.

			"itemContent": "<p>Andreas Werckmeister (1645&ndash;1706) was a musician and expert on the organ.  Compared to <a href=\"https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2024/02/05/well-temperaments-part-4/\">Kirnberger</a>, his life seems outwardly dull.  He got his musical training from his uncles, and from the age of 19 to his death he worked as an organist in three German towns.  That&#8217;s about all I know.</p>\n<p>His fame comes from the tremendous impact of his  his theoretical writings.  Most importantly, in his 1687 book <i>Musikalische Temperatur</i> he described the first &#8216;well tempered&#8217; tuning systems for keyboards, where every key sounds acceptable but each has its own personality.  Johann Sebastian Bach read and was influenced by Werckmeister&#8217;s work.  The first book of Bach&#8217;s <i>Well-Tempered Clavier</i> came out in 1722&#8212;the first collection of keyboard pieces in all 24 keys.</p>\n<p>But Bach was also influenced by Werckmeister&#8217;s writings on counterpoint.  Werckmeister believed that well-written counterpoint reflected the orderly movements of the planets&mdash;especially <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_(music)#Counterpoint\">invertible counterpoint</a>, where as the music goes on, a melody that starts in the high voice switches to the low voice and vice versa.  Bach&#8217;s Invention No. 13 in A minor is full of invertible counterpoint:</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/cultural/invertible_counterpoint.jpg\" />\n</div>\n<p>The connection to planets may sound bizarre now, but the &#8216;music of the spheres&#8217; or &#8216;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musica_universalis\">musica universalis</a>’ was a long-lived and influential idea.  Werckmeister was influenced by Kepler&#8217;s 1619 <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonices_Mundi\">Harmonices Mundi</a></i>, which has pictures like this:</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musica_universalis\"><img width=\"450\" src=\"https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/Hamonices_Mundi_planetary_scales.jpg\" /><br />\n</a>\n</div>\n<p>But the connection between music and astronomy goes back much further: at least to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy\">Claudius Ptolemy</a>, and probably even earlier.  Ptolemy is most famous for his <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almagest\">Almagest</a></i>, which quite accurately described planetary motions using a geocentric system with epicycles.  But his <i><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/solomon-1999-ptolemy-harmonics\">Harmonikon</a></i>, written around 150 AD, is the first place where <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy%27s_intense_diatonic_scale\">just intonation</a> is clearly described, along with a number of related tuning systems.  And it&#8217;s important to note that this book is not just about &#8216;harmony theory&#8217;.  It&#8217;s about a subject he calls &#8216;harmonics&#8217;: the general study of vibrating or oscillating systems, including the planets.   Thinking hard about this, it become clearer and clearer why the classical &#8216;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrivium\">quadrivium</a>’ grouped together arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy.</p>\n<p>In <i>Grove Music Online</i>, George Buelow digs a bit deeper:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nWerckmeister was essentially unaffected by the innovations of Italian Baroque music. His musical surroundings were nourished by traditions whose roots lay in medieval thought. The study of music was thus for him a speculative science related to theology and mathematics. In his treatises he subjected every aspect of music to two criteria: how it contributed to an expression of the spirit of God, and, as a corollary, how that expression was the result of an order of mathematical principles emanating from God.</p>\n<blockquote><p> &#8220;Music is a great gift and miracle from God, an art above all arts because it is prescribed by God himself for his service.&#8221; (<i>Hypomnemata musica</i>, 1697.)\n</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p> &#8220;Music is a mathematical science, which shows us through number the correct differences and ratios of sounds from which we can compose a suitable and natural harmony.&#8221; (<i>Musicae mathematicae Hodegus curiosus</i>, 1686.)\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Musical harmony, he believed, actually reflected the harmony of Creation, and, inspired by the writings of Johannes Kepler, he thought that the heavenly constellations emitted their own musical harmonies, created by God to influence humankind. He took up a middle-of-the-road position in the ancient argument as to whether Ratio (reason) or Sensus (the senses) should rule music and preferred to believe in a rational interplay of the two forces, but in many of his views he remained a mystic and decidedly medieval. No other writer of the period regarded music so unequivocally as the end result of God’s work, and his invaluable interpretations of the symbolic reality of God in number as expressed by musical notes supports the conclusions of scholars who have found number symbolism as theological abstractions in the music of Bach. For example, he not only saw the triad as a musical symbol and actual presence of the Trinity but described the three tones of the triad as symbolizing 1 = the Lord, 2 = Christ and 3 = the Holy Ghost.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Trinity symbolism may seem wacky, but many people believe it pervades the works of Bach.  I&#8217;m not convinced yet&mdash;it&#8217;s not hard to find the number 3 in music, after all.  But if Bach read and was influenced by the works of Werckmeister, maybe there really is something to these theories.</p>\n<h3> Werckmeister&#8217;s tuning systems </h3>\n<p>As his name suggests, Werckmeister was a real workaholic.  There are no less than five numbered tuning systems named after him&mdash;although the first two were not new.  Of these systems, the star is Werckmeister III.  I&#8217;ll talk more about that one next time.  But let&#8217;s look briefly at all five.</p>\n<h4>Werckmeister I</h4>\n<p>This is another name for just intonation.  Just intonation goes back at least to Ptolemy, and it had its heyday of popularity from about 1300 to 1550.  I discussed it extensively starting <a href=\"https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2023/10/30/just-intonation-part-1/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Werckmeister II</h4>\n<p>This is another name for quarter-comma meantone.  Quarter-comma meantone was extremely popular from about 1550 until around 1690, when well temperaments started taking over.  I discussed it extensively starting <a href=\"https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2023/12/13/quarter-comma-meantone-part-1/\">here</a>, but remember:</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/cultural/temperaments/temperament_quarter-comma.jpg\"><img width=\"450\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/cultural/temperaments/temperament_quarter-comma.jpg\" /></a></div>\n<p>All but one of the fifths are 1/4 comma flat, making the thirds built from those fifths &#8216;just&#8217;, with frequency ratios of exactly 5/4: these are the black arrows labelled 0.  Unfortunately, the sum of the numbers on the circle of fifths needs to be -1.  This forces the remaining fifth to be 7/4 commas sharp: it&#8217;s a painfully out-of-tune &#8216;wolf fifth&#8217;.  And the thirds that cross this fifth are forced to be even worse: 8/4 commas sharp.   Those are the problems that Werckmeister sought to solve with his next tuning system!</p>\n<h4>Werckmeister III</h4>\n<p>This was probably the world&#8217;s first well tempered tuning system!  It&#8217;s definitely one of the most popular.  Here it is:</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/cultural/temperaments/temperament_werckmeister_III.jpg\"><img width=\"450\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/cultural/temperaments/temperament_werckmeister_III.jpg\" /></a></div>\n<p>4 of the fifths are 1/4 comma flat, so the total of the numbers around the circle is -1, as required by the laws of math, without needing any positive numbers.  This means we don&#8217;t need any fifths to be sharp.  That&#8217;s nice.  But the subtlety of the system is the <i>location</i> of the flatted fifths: starting from C in the circle of fifths they are the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and&#8230; not the 4th, but the 6th!</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll talk about this more next time.   For now, here&#8217;s a more elementary point.  Comparing this system to quarter-comma meantone, you can see that it&#8217;s greatly smoothed down: instead of really <i>great</i> thirds in black and really <i>terrible</i> ones in garish fluorescent green, Werckmeister III has a gentle gradient of mellow hues.  That&#8217;s &#8216;well temperament&#8217; in a nutshell.</p>\n<p>For more, see:</p>\n<p>&bull; Wikipedia, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werckmeister_temperament#Werckmeister_I_(III):_%22correct_temperament%22_based_on_1/4_comma_divisions\">Werckmeister temperament III</a>.</p>\n<h4>Werckmeister IV</h4>\n<p>This system is based not on 1/4 commas but on 1/3 commas!</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/cultural/temperaments/temperament_werckmeister_IV.jpg\"><img width=\"450\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/cultural/temperaments/temperament_werckmeister_IV.jpg\" /></a></div>\n<p>As we go around the circle of fifths starting from B&#9837;, every other fifth is 1/3 comma flat&#8230; for a while.  But if we kept doing this around the whole circle, we&#8217;d get a total of -4.  The total has to be -1.   So we eventually need to compensate, and Werckmeister IV does so by making two fifths 1/3 comma sharp.</p>\n<p>I will say more about Werckmeister IV in a post devoted to systems that use 1/3 and 1/6 commas.  But you can already see that its color gradient is sharper than Werckmeister III.  Probably as a consequence, it was never very popular.</p>\n<p>For more, see:</p>\n<p>&bull; Wikipedia, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werckmeister_temperament#Werckmeister_II_(IV):_another_temperament_included_in_the_Orgelprobe,_divided_up_through_1/3_comma\">Werckmeister temperament IV</a>.</p>\n<h4>Werckmeister V</h4>\n<p>This is another system based on 1/4 commas:</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/cultural/temperaments/temperament_werckmeister_V.jpg\"> <img width=\"450\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/cultural/temperaments/temperament_werckmeister_V.jpg\" /></a></div>\n<p>Compared to Werckmeister III this has an extra fifth that&#8217;s a quarter comma flat&mdash;and thus, to compensate, a fifth that&#8217;s a quarter comma <i>sharp</i>.  The location of the flat fifths seems a bit more random, but that&#8217;s probably just my ignorance.</p>\n<p>For more, see:</p>\n<p>&bull; Wikipedia, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werckmeister_temperament#Werckmeister_III_(V):_an_additional_temperament_divided_up_through_1/4_comma\">Werckmeister temperament V</a>.</p>\n<h4>Werckmeister VI</h4>\n<p>This system is based on a completely different principle.  It also has another really cool-sounding name&mdash;the &#8216;septenarius tuning&#8217;&mdash;because it&#8217;s based on dividing a string into 196 = 7 × 7 × 4 equal parts.  The resulting scale has only rational numbers as frequency ratios, unlike all the other well temperaments I&#8217;m discussing.  Werckmeister described this system as &#8220;an additional temperament which has nothing at all to do with the divisions of the comma, nevertheless in practice so correct that one can be really satisfied with it&#8221;.  For details, go here:</p>\n<p>&bull; Wikipedia, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werckmeister_temperament#Werckmeister_IV_(VI):_the_Septenarius_tunings\">Werckmeister temperament VI</a>.</p>\n<h3> Werckmeister on equal temperament </h3>\n<p>Werckmeister was way ahead of his time.  He was not only the first, or one of the first, to systematically pursue well temperaments.  He also was one of the first to embrace <a href=\"https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2023/10/13/perfect-fifths-in-equal-tempered-scales/\">equal temperament</a>!  This system took over around 1790, and rules to this day.  But Werckmeister advocated it much earlier&mdash;most notably in his final book, published in 1707, one year after his death.</p>\n<p>There is an excellent article about this:</p>\n<p>&bull; Dietrich Bartel, <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/24750846\">Andreas Werckmeister&#8217;s final tuning: the path to equal temperament</a>, <i>Early Music</i> <b>43</b> (2015), 503&ndash;512.</p>\n<p>You can read it for free if you register for JSTOR.   It&#8217;s so nice that I&#8217;ll quote the beginning:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nAny discussion regarding Baroque keyboard tunings normally includes the assumption that Baroque musicians employed a variety of unequal temperaments, allowing them to play in all keys but with individual keys exhibiting unique characteristics, the more frequently used diatonic keys featuring purer 3rds than the less common chromatic ones. Figuring prominently in this discussion are Andreas Werckmeister&#8217;s various suggestions for tempered tuning, which he introduces in his <i>Musicalische Temperatur</i>. This is not Werckmeister&#8217;s last word on the subject. In fact, the <i>Musicalische Temperatur</i> is an early publication, and the following decade would see numerous further publications by him, a number of which speak on the subject of temperament.</p>\n<p>Of particular interest in this regard are <i>Hypomnemata Musica</i> (in particular chapter 11), <i>Die Nothwendigsten Anmerckungen</i> (specifically the appendix in the undated second edition}, <i>Erweiterte und verbesserte Orgel-Probe</i> (in particular chapter 32), <i>Harmonologia Musica</i> (in particular paragraph 27) and <i>Musicalische Paradoxal-Discourse</i> (in particular chapters 13 and 23-5). Throughout these publications, Werckmeister increasingly championed equal temperament. Indeed, in his <i>Paradoxal Discourse</i> much of the discussion concerning other theoretical issues rests on the assumption of equal temperament. Also apparent is his increasing concern with theological speculation, resulting in a theological justification taking precedence over a musical one in his argument for equal temperament.  This article traces Werckmeister&#8217;s path to equal temperament by examining his references to it in his publications and identifying the supporting arguments for his insistence on equal temperament.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>In his <i>Paradoxal Discourse</i>, Werckmeister wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nSome may no doubt be astonished that I now wish to institute a temperament in which all 5ths are tempered by 1/12, major 3rds by 2/3 and minor 3rds by 3/4 of a comma, resulting in all consonances possessing equal temperament, a tuning which I did not explicitly introduce in my <i>Monochord</i>.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is indeed equal temperament:</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/cultural/temperaments/temperament_equal-tempered.jpg\"></a><a href=\"https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/temperament_equal-tempered.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"37439\" data-permalink=\"https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2024/02/19/well-temperaments-part-5/temperament_equal-tempered/\" data-orig-file=\"https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/temperament_equal-tempered.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1007,1001\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"temperament_equal-tempered\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/temperament_equal-tempered.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/temperament_equal-tempered.jpg?w=450\" src=\"https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/temperament_equal-tempered.jpg?w=450&#038;h=447\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"447\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-37439\" srcset=\"https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/temperament_equal-tempered.jpg?w=450 450w, https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/temperament_equal-tempered.jpg?w=900 900w, https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/temperament_equal-tempered.jpg?w=150 150w, https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/temperament_equal-tempered.jpg?w=300 300w, https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/temperament_equal-tempered.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" /></a></div>\n<p>And in a pun on &#8216;wolf fifth&#8217;, he makes an excuse for not talking about equal temperament earlier:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nHad I straightaway assigned the 3rds of the diatonic genus, that tempering which would be demanded by a subdivision of the comma into twelve parts, I would have been completely torn apart by the wolves of ignorance.  Therefore it is difficult to eradicate an error straightaway and at once.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, it seems more likely to me that his position evolved over the years.</p>\n<h3> What&#8217;s next? </h3>\n<p>You are probably getting overwhelmed by the diversity of tuning systems.  Me too!  To deal with this, I need to compare similar systems.  So, next time I will compare systems that are based on making a bunch of fifths a quarter comma flat.  The time after that, I&#8217;ll compare systems that are based on making a bunch of fifths a third or a sixth of a comma flat.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>For more on Pythagorean tuning, read this series:</p>\n<p>&bull; <a href=\"https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2023/10/07/pythagorean-tuning/\">Pythagorean tuning</a>.</p>\n<p>For more on just intonation, read this series:</p>\n<p>&bull; <a href=\"https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2023/10/30/just-intonation-part-1/\">Just intonation</a>.</p>\n<p>For more on quarter-comma meantone tuning, read this series:</p>\n<p>&bull; <a href=\"https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2023/12/13/quarter-comma-meantone-part-1/\">Quarter-comma meantone</a>.</p>\n<p>For more on well-tempered scales, read this series:</p>\n<p>&bull; <a href=\"https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2024/01/11/well-temperaments-part-1/\">Part 1</a>.
