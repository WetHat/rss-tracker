> [!abstract] Replied to: @WetHat There can be significant benefits with static readonly fields, see https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-8/#tiering-and-dynamic-pgo and https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-8/#constant-folding IIRC, the JIT will also optimize multiple loads of the same field better in some cases if it is readonly. by @WetHat - 2024-05-13T16:15:50.000Z
