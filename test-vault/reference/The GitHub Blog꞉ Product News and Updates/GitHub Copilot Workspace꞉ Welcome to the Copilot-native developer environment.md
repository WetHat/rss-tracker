|Weâ€™re redefining the developer environment with GitHub Copilot Workspaceâ€“where any developer can go from idea, to code, to software in natural language. [Sign up here](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-workspace).|

In the past two years, generative AI has foundationally changed the developer landscape largely as a tool embedded inside the developer environment. In 2022, we launched GitHub Copilot as an autocomplete pair programmer in the editor, [boosting developer productivity by up to 55%](https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/). Copilot is now the most widely adopted AI developer tool. In 2023, we released GitHub Copilot Chatâ€”unlocking the power of natural language in coding, debugging, and testingâ€”allowing developers to converse with their code in real time.

After sharing [an early glimpse](https://github.blog/2023-11-08-universe-2023-copilot-transforms-github-into-the-ai-powered-developer-platform/) at GitHub Universe last year, today, we are reimagining the nature of the developer experience itself with the technical preview of GitHub Copilot Workspace: the Copilot-native developer environment. Within Copilot Workspace, developers can now brainstorm, plan, build, test, and run code in natural language. This new task-centric experience leverages different Copilot-powered agents from start to finish, while giving developers full control over every step of the process.

Copilot Workspace represents a radically new way of building software with natural language, and is expressly [designed](https://github.blog/2024-01-17-a-developers-second-brain-reducing-complexity-through-partnership-with-ai/) to deliverâ€“not replaceâ€“developer creativity, faster and easier than ever before. With Copilot Workspace we will empower more experienced developers to operate as systems thinkers, and materially lower the barrier of entry for who can build software.

Welcome to the first day of a new developer environment. Hereâ€™s how it works:

### It all starts with the taskâ€¦[](#it-all-starts-with-the-task)

![It starts with a task. Open GitHub Copilot Workspace from a GitHub Issue, Pull Request, or Repository. (Screenshot of an issue in the octoacademy repository.)](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/octoacademy-projects.png?w=1024&resize=1024%2C593)

For developers, the greatest barrier to entry is almost always at the [beginning](https://github.blog/2023-11-08-universe-2023-copilot-transforms-github-into-the-ai-powered-developer-platform/). Think of how often you hit a wall in the first steps of a big project, feature request, or even bug report, simply because you donâ€™t know how to get started. GitHub Copilot Workspace meets developers right at the origin: a GitHub Repository or a GitHub Issue. By leveraging Copilot agents as a second brain, developers will have AI assistance from the very beginning of an idea.

### â€¦Workspace builds the full plan[](#workspace-builds-the-full-plan)

![Progress from your task to a specification, outlining what you want to achieve with Copilot Workspace. The steps are editable, enabling you to iterate on ideas.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/3-Plan-of-Action-Zoom-with-BG.png?w=1024&resize=1024%2C607)

From there, Copilot Workspace offers a step-by-step plan to solve the issue based on its deep understanding of the codebase, issue replies, and more. It gives you everything you need to validate the plan, and test the code, in one streamlined list in natural language.

### And itâ€™s entirely editableâ€¦[](#and-its-entirely-editable)

![Then adjust your plan of action, adding steps, and general notes. Once the plan is implemented, you can view changes with a PR diff view and make edits as needed.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/copilot-workspace.png?w=1024&resize=1024%2C593)

Everything that GitHub Copilot Workspace proposesâ€”from the plan to the codeâ€”is fully editable, allowing you to iterate until youâ€™re confident in the path ahead. You retain all of the autonomy, while Copilot Workspace lifts your cognitive strain.

![Once you're happy with the code, you can use the integrated terminal to run unit tests, builds and appropriate checks.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4.1-Run-code-in-Copilot-Workspace-v3.png?w=1024&resize=1024%2C604)

And once youâ€™re satisfied with the plan, you can run your code directly in Copilot Workspace, jump into the underlying GitHub Codespace, and tweak all code changes until you are happy with the final result. You can also instantly share a workspace with your team via a link, so they can view your work and even try out their own iterations.

All thatâ€™s left then is to file your pull request, run your GitHub Actions, security code scanning, and ask your team members for human code review. And best of all, they can leverage your Copilot Workspace to see how you got from idea to code.

### Also: GitHub Copilot Workspace is mobile compatible[](#also-github-copilot-workspace-is-mobile-compatible)

And because ideas can happen anywhere, GitHub Copilot Workspace was designed to be used from any deviceâ€”empowering a real-world development environment that can work on a desktop, laptop, or on the go.

This is our mark on the future of the development environment: an intuitive, Copilot-powered infrastructure that makes it easier to get started, to learn, and ultimately to execute.

## Enabling a world with 1B developers[](#enabling-a-world-with-1b-developers)

Early last year, GitHub celebrated over [100 million developers](https://github.blog/2023-01-25-100-million-developers-and-counting/) on our platformâ€”and counting. As programming in natural language lowers the barrier of entry to who can build software, we are accelerating to a near future where [one billion people](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/the-next-billion-developers-perspective/) on GitHub will control a machine just as easily as they ride a bicycle. Weâ€™ve constructed GitHub Copilot Workspace in pursuit of this horizon, as a conduit to help extend the economic opportunity and joy of building software to every human on the planet.

At the same time, we live in a world dependent onâ€”and in short supply ofâ€”professional developers. Around the world, developers add millions of lines of code every single day to evermore complex systems and are increasingly behind on maintaining the old ones. Just like any infrastructure in this world, we need real experts to maintain and renew the worldâ€™s code. By quantifiably reducing boilerplate work, we will empower professional developers to increasingly operate as systems thinkers. We believe the step change in productivity gains that professional developers will experience by virtue of Copilot and now Copilot Workspace will only continue to [increase labor demand](https://github.blog/2023-06-27-the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).

Thatâ€™s the dual potential of GitHub Copilot: for the professional and hobbyist developer alike, channeling creativity into code just got a whole lot easier.

**Today, we begin the technical preview for GitHub Copilot Workspace.**

We canâ€™t wait to see what you will build from here.
