This gets me the benefit of all of the assertions of a full unit testing framework, and all the benefits of using something like Playwright to automate my browser. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/real-browser-integration-testing-with-selenium-standalone-chrome-and-aspnet-core-21\">In 2018 I was using WebApplicationFactory</a> and some tricky hacks to basically spin up ASP.NET within .NET (at the time) Core 2.1 within the unit tests and then launching Selenium. This was kind of janky and would require to manually start a separate process and manage its life cycle. However, I kept on with this hack for a number of years basically trying to get the Kestrel Web Server to spin up inside of my unit tests.</p> <p>I've recently upgraded my main site and podcast site to .NET 8. Keep in mind that I've been moving my websites forward from early early versions of .NET to the most recent versions. The blog is happily running on Linux in a container on .NET 8, but its original code started in 2002 on .NET 1.1.</p> <p>Now that I'm on .NET 8, I scandalously discovered (as my unit tests stopped working) <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/22-to-30?view=aspnetcore-3.1&amp;tabs=visual-studio#hostbuilder-replaces-webhostbuilder\">that the rest of the world had moved from IWebHostBuilder to IHostBuilder five version of .NET ago</a>. Gulp. Say what you will, but the backward compatibility is impressive. </p> <p>As such my code for Program.cs changed from this</p><pre class=\"brush: csharp; gutter: false; toolbar: false; auto-links: false; smart-tabs: false;\">public static void Main(string[] args)<br>{<br>    CreateWebHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();<br>}<br><br>public static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args) =&gt;<br>    WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)<br>        .UseStartup&lt;Startup&gt;();<br></pre>\n<p>to this:</p><pre class=\"brush: csharp; gutter: false; toolbar: false; auto-links: false; smart-tabs: false;\">public static void Main(string[] args)<br>{<br>  CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();<br>}<br><br>public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =&gt;<br>  Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args).<br>      ConfigureWebHostDefaults(WebHostBuilder =&gt; WebHostBuilder.UseStartup&lt;Startup&gt;());</pre>\n<p>Not a major change on the outside but tidies things up on the inside and sets me up with <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/generic-host?view=aspnetcore-3.1\">a more flexible generic host for my web app</a>.</p>\n<p>My unit tests stopped working because my Kestral Web Server hack was no longer firing up my server. </p>\n<p>Here is an example of my goal from a Playwright perspective within a .NET NUnit test. </p><pre class=\"brush: csharp; gutter: false; toolbar: false; auto-links: false; smart-tabs: false;\">[Test]<br>public async Task DoesSearchWork()<br>{<br>    await Page.GotoAsync(Url);<br><br>    await Page.Locator(\"#topbar\").GetByRole(AriaRole.Link, new() { Name = \"episodes\" }).ClickAsync();<br><br>    await Page.GetByPlaceholder(\"search and filter\").ClickAsync();<br><br>    await Page.GetByPlaceholder(\"search and filter\").TypeAsync(\"wife\");<br><br>    const string visibleCards = \".showCard:visible\";<br><br>    var waiting = await Page.WaitForSelectorAsync(visibleCards, new PageWaitForSelectorOptions() { Timeout = 500 });<br><br>    await Expect(Page.Locator(visibleCards).First).ToBeVisibleAsync();<br><br>    await Expect(Page.Locator(visibleCards)).ToHaveCountAsync(5);<br>}\n</pre>\n<p>I love this. Nice and clean. Certainly here we are assuming that we have a URL in that first line, which will be localhost something, and then we assume that our web application has started up on its own. </p>\n<p>Here is the setup code that starts my new \"web application test builder factory,\" yeah, the name is stupid but it's descriptive. Note the OneTimeSetUp and the OneTimeTearDown. This starts my web app within the context of my TestHost. Note the :0 makes the app find a port which I then, sadly, have to dig out and put into the Url private for use within my Unit Tests. Note that the &lt;Startup&gt; is in fact my Startup class within Startup.cs which hosts my app's pipeline and Configure and ConfigureServices get setup here so routing all works.</p><pre class=\"brush: csharp; gutter: false; toolbar: false; auto-links: false; smart-tabs: false;\">private string Url;<br>private WebApplication? _app = null;<br><br>[OneTimeSetUp]<br>public void Setup()<br>{<br>    var builder = WebApplicationTestBuilderFactory.CreateBuilder&lt;Startup&gt;();<br><br>    var startup = new Startup(builder.Environment);<br>    builder.WebHost.ConfigureKestrel(o =&gt; o.Listen(IPAddress.Loopback, 0));<br>    startup.ConfigureServices(builder.Services);<br>    _app = builder.Build();<br><br>    // listen on any local port (hence the 0)<br>    startup.Configure(_app, _app.Configuration);<br>    _app.Start();<br><br>    //you are kidding me<br>    Url = _app.Services.GetRequiredService&lt;IServer&gt;().Features.GetRequiredFeature&lt;IServerAddressesFeature&gt;().Addresses.Last();<br>}<br><br>[OneTimeTearDown]<br>public async Task TearDown()<br>{<br>    await _app.DisposeAsync();<br>}</pre>\n<p>So what horrors are buried in WebApplicationTestBuilderFactory? The first bit is bad and we should fix it for .NET 9. The rest is actually every nice, with a hat tip to David Fowler for his help and guidance! This is the magic and the ick in one small helper class.</p><pre class=\"brush: csharp; gutter: false; toolbar: false; auto-links: false; smart-tabs: false;\">public class WebApplicationTestBuilderFactory <br>{<br>    public static WebApplicationBuilder CreateBuilder&lt;T&gt;() where T : class <br>    {<br>        //This ungodly code requires an unused reference to the MvcTesting package that hooks up<br>        //  MSBuild to create the manifest file that is read here.<br>        var testLocation = Path.Combine(AppContext.BaseDirectory, \"MvcTestingAppManifest.json\");<br>        var json = JsonObject.Parse(File.ReadAllText(testLocation));<br>        var asmFullName = typeof(T).Assembly.FullName ?? throw new InvalidOperationException(\"Assembly Full Name is null\");<br>        var contentRootPath = json?[asmFullName]?.GetValue&lt;string&gt;();<br><br>        //spin up a real live web application inside TestHost.exe<br>        var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(<br>            new WebApplicationOptions()<br>            {<br>                ContentRootPath = contentRootPath,<br>                ApplicationName = asmFullName<br>            });<br>        return builder;<br>    }<br>}</pre>\n<p>The first 4 lines are nasty. Because the test runs in the context of a different directory and my website needs to run within the context of its own content root path, I have to force the content root path to be correct and the only way to do that is by getting the apps base directory from a file generated within MSBuild from the (aging) MvcTesting package. The package is not used, but by referencing it it gets into the build and makes that file that I then use to pull out the directory. </p>\n<p>If we can get rid of that \"hack\" and pull the directory from context elsewhere, then this helper function turns into a single line and .NET 9 gets WAY WAY more testable!</p>\n<p>Now I can run my Unit Tests AND Playwright Browser Integration Tests across all OS's, headed or headless, in docker or on the metal. The site is updated to .NET 8 and all is right with my code. Well, it runs at least. ;)</p><br/><hr/>© 2021 Scott Hanselman.

Say what you will, but the backward compatibility is impressive. </p> <p>As such my code for Program.cs changed from this</p><pre class=\"brush: csharp; gutter: false; toolbar: false; auto-links: false; smart-tabs: false;\">public static void Main(string[] args)\n<br>{\n<br>    CreateWebHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();\n<br>}\n<br>\n<br>public static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args) =&gt;\n<br>    WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)\n<br>        .UseStartup&lt;Startup&gt;();\n<br></pre>\n<p>to this:</p><pre class=\"brush: csharp; gutter: false; toolbar: false; auto-links: false; smart-tabs: false;\">public static void Main(string[] args)\n<br>{\n<br>  CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();\n<br>}\n<br>\n<br>public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =&gt;\n<br>  Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args).\n<br>      ConfigureWebHostDefaults(WebHostBuilder =&gt; WebHostBuilder.UseStartup&lt;Startup&gt;());</pre>\n<p>Not a major change on the outside but tidies things up on the inside and sets me up with <a href=\"https://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/generic-host?view=aspnetcore-3.1\">a more flexible generic host for my web app</a>.</p>\n<p>My unit tests stopped working because my Kestral Web Server hack was no longer firing up my server. </p>\n<p>Here is an example of my goal from a Playwright perspective within a .NET NUnit test. </p><pre class=\"brush: csharp; gutter: false; toolbar: false; auto-links: false; smart-tabs: false;\">[Test]\n<br>public async Task DoesSearchWork()\n<br>{\n<br>    await Page.GotoAsync(Url);\n<br>\n<br>    await Page.Locator(\"#topbar\").GetByRole(AriaRole.Link, new() { Name = \"episodes\" }).ClickAsync();\n<br>\n<br>    await Page.GetByPlaceholder(\"search and filter\").ClickAsync();\n<br>\n<br>    await Page.GetByPlaceholder(\"search and filter\").TypeAsync(\"wife\");\n<br>\n<br>    const string visibleCards = \".showCard:visible\";\n<br>\n<br>    var waiting = await Page.WaitForSelectorAsync(visibleCards, new PageWaitForSelectorOptions() { Timeout = 500 });\n<br>\n<br>    await Expect(Page.Locator(visibleCards).First).ToBeVisibleAsync();\n<br>\n<br>    await Expect(Page.Locator(visibleCards)).ToHaveCountAsync(5);\n<br>}\n</pre>\n<p>I love this. Nice and clean. Certainly here we are assuming that we have a URL in that first line, which will be localhost something, and then we assume that our web application has started up on its own. </p>\n<p>Here is the setup code that starts my new \"web application test builder factory,\" yeah, the name is stupid but it's descriptive. Note the OneTimeSetUp and the OneTimeTearDown. This starts my web app within the context of my TestHost. Note the :0 makes the app find a port which I then, sadly, have to dig out and put into the Url private for use within my Unit Tests. Note that the &lt;Startup&gt; is in fact my Startup class within Startup.cs which hosts my app's pipeline and Configure and ConfigureServices get setup here so routing all works.</p><pre class=\"brush: csharp; gutter: false; toolbar: false; auto-links: false; smart-tabs: false;\">private string Url;\n<br>private WebApplication? _app = null;\n<br>\n<br>[OneTimeSetUp]\n<br>public void Setup()\n<br>{\n<br>    var builder = WebApplicationTestBuilderFactory.CreateBuilder&lt;Startup&gt;();\n<br>\n<br>    var startup = new Startup(builder.Environment);\n<br>    builder.WebHost.ConfigureKestrel(o =&gt; o.Listen(IPAddress.Loopback, 0));\n<br>    startup.ConfigureServices(builder.Services);\n<br>    _app = builder.Build();\n<br>\n<br>    // listen on any local port (hence the 0)\n<br>    startup.Configure(_app, _app.Configuration);\n<br>    _app.Start();\n<br>\n<br>    //you are kidding me\n<br>    Url = _app.Services.GetRequiredService&lt;IServer&gt;().Features.GetRequiredFeature&lt;IServerAddressesFeature&gt;().Addresses.Last();\n<br>}\n<br>\n<br>[OneTimeTearDown]\n<br>public async Task TearDown()\n<br>{\n<br>    await _app.DisposeAsync();\n<br>}</pre>\n<p>So what horrors are buried in WebApplicationTestBuilderFactory? The first bit is bad and we should fix it for .NET 9. The rest is actually every nice, with a hat tip to David Fowler for his help and guidance! This is the magic and the ick in one small helper class.</p><pre class=\"brush: csharp; gutter: false; toolbar: false; auto-links: false; smart-tabs: false;\">public class WebApplicationTestBuilderFactory \n<br>{\n<br>    public static WebApplicationBuilder CreateBuilder&lt;T&gt;() where T : class \n<br>    {\n<br>        //This ungodly code requires an unused reference to the MvcTesting package that hooks up\n<br>        //  MSBuild to create the manifest file that is read here.\n<br>        var testLocation = Path.Combine(AppContext.BaseDirectory, \"MvcTestingAppManifest.json\");\n<br>        var json = JsonObject.Parse(File.ReadAllText(testLocation));\n<br>        var asmFullName = typeof(T).Assembly.FullName ?? throw new InvalidOperationException(\"Assembly Full Name is null\");\n<br>        var contentRootPath = json?[asmFullName]?.GetValue&lt;string&gt;();\n<br>\n<br>        //spin up a real live web application inside TestHost.exe\n<br>        var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(\n<br>            new WebApplicationOptions()\n<br>            {\n<br>                ContentRootPath = contentRootPath,\n<br>                ApplicationName = asmFullName\n<br>            });\n<br>        return builder;\n<br>    }\n<br>}</pre>\n<p>The first 4 lines are nasty. Because the test runs in the context of a different directory and my website needs to run within the context of its own content root path, I have to force the content root path to be correct and the only way to do that is by getting the apps base directory from a file generated within MSBuild from the (aging) MvcTesting package. The package is not used, but by referencing it it gets into the build and makes that file that I then use to pull out the directory. </p>\n<p>If we can get rid of that \"hack\" and pull the directory from context elsewhere, then this helper function turns into a single line and .NET 9 gets WAY WAY more testable!</p>\n<p>Now I can run my Unit Tests AND Playwright Browser Integration Tests across all OS's, headed or headless, in docker or on the metal. The site is updated to .NET 8 and all is right with my code. Well, it runs at least. ;)</p>\n<br/><hr/>© 2021 Scott Hanselman.

You can sign up for their waitlist at the <a href=\"https://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-cli/\">Copilot for CLI site</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>Copilot for CLI provides three shell commands: <code>??</code>, <code>git?</code> and <code>gh?</code></p></blockquote> <p>This is cool and all, but I use PowerShell. Turns out these ?? commands are just router commands to a larger EXE called github-copilot-cli. So if you go \"?? something\" you're really going \"github-copilot-cli what-the-shell something.\"</p> <p>So this means I should be able to to do the same/similar aliases for my PowerShell prompt AND change the injected prompt (look at me I'm a prompt engineer) to add 'use powershell to.' </p> <p>Now it's not perfect, but hopefully it will make the point to the Copilot CLI team that PowerShell needs love also.</p> <p>Here are my aliases. Feel free to suggest if these suck. Note the addition of \"user powershell to\" for the ?? one. I may make a ?? and a p? where one does bash and one does PowerShell. I could also have it use wsl.exe and shell out to bash. Lots of possibilities.</p><pre class=\"brush: ps; gutter: false; toolbar: false; collapse: false; smart-tabs: false;\">function ?? { \n<br>    $TmpFile = New-TemporaryFile \n<br>    github-copilot-cli what-the-shell ('use powershell to ' + $args) --shellout $TmpFile \n<br>    if ([System.IO.File]::Exists($TmpFile)) { \n<br>        $TmpFileContents = Get-Content $TmpFile \n<br>            if ($TmpFileContents -ne $nill) {\n<br>            Invoke-Expression $TmpFileContents \n<br>            Remove-Item $TmpFile \n<br>        }\n<br>    }\n<br>}\n<br>\n<br>function git? {\n<br>    $TmpFile = New-TemporaryFile\n<br>    github-copilot-cli git-assist $args --shellout $TmpFile\n<br>    if ([System.IO.File]::Exists($TmpFile)) {\n<br>        $TmpFileContents = Get-Content $TmpFile \n<br>            if ($TmpFileContents -ne $nill) {\n<br>            Invoke-Expression $TmpFileContents \n<br>            Remove-Item $TmpFile \n<br>        }\n<br>    }\n<br>}\n<br>function gh? {\n<br>    $TmpFile = New-TemporaryFile\n<br>    github-copilot-cli gh-assist $args --shellout $TmpFile\n<br>    if ([System.IO.File]::Exists($TmpFile)) {\n<br>        $TmpFileContents = Get-Content $TmpFile \n<br>            if ($TmpFileContents -ne $nill) {\n<br>            Invoke-Expression $TmpFileContents \n<br>            Remove-Item $TmpFile \n<br>        }\n<br>    }\n<br>} </pre>\n<p>It also then offers to run the command.

It was created in 2016 as an alternative to centralized social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. <p>One of the key features of Mastodon is the use of the WebFinger protocol, which allows users to discover and access information about other users on the Mastodon network. WebFinger is a simple HTTP-based protocol that enables a user to discover information about other users or resources on the internet by using their email address or other identifying information. The WebFinger protocol is important for Mastodon because it enables users to find and follow each other on the network, regardless of where they are hosted. <p>WebFinger uses a \"well known\" path structure when calling an domain. You may be familiar with the robots.txt convention. We all just agree that robots.txt will sit at the top path of everyone's domain. <p>The WebFinger protocol is a simple HTTP-based protocol that enables a user or search to discover information about other users or resources on the internet by using their email address or other identifying information.

This JSON object is called a \"resource descriptor.\"</p> <li> <p>The user's client receives the resource descriptor and displays the information to the user.</p></li></ol> <p>The resource descriptor contains various types of information about the user or resource, such as their name, profile picture, and links to their social media accounts or other online resources. It can also include other types of information, such as the user's public key, which can be used to establish a secure connection with the user. <p>There's <a href=\"https://guide.toot.as/guide/use-your-own-domain/\">a great explainer here as well</a>.

I've interviewed <a href=\"https://hanselminutes.com/788/automating-all-the-things-with-home-assistants-paulus-schoutsen\">the creator of Home Assistant on my podcast</a> and I encourage you to check out that chat.</p> <p>Home Assistant can quickly become a hobby that overwhelms you. Every object (entity) in your house that is even remotely connected can become programmable. Everything. Even people! You can declare that any name:value pair that (for example) your phone can expose can be consumable by Home Assistant. Questions like \"is Scott home\" or \"what's Scott's phone battery\" can be associated with Scott the Entity in the Home Assistant Dashboard. </p> <blockquote> <p>I was amazed at the devices/objects that Home Assistant discovered that it could automate. Lights, remotes, Spotify, and more. You'll find that any internally connected device you have likely has an Integration available.</p></blockquote> <p>Temperature, Light Status, sure, that's easy Home Automation. But integrations and 3rd party code can give you details like \"Is the Living Room dark\" or \"is there motion in the driveway.\" From these building blocks, you can then build your own IFTTT (If This Then That) automations, combining not just two systems, but any and all disparate systems.</p> <p>What's the best part? This all runs LOCALLY. Not in a cloud or the cloud or anyone's cloud. I've got my stuff running on a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3HnJ3IY\">Raspberry Pi 4</a>. Even better I put a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3HnJ3IY\">Power Over Ethernet (PoE) hat on my Rpi</a> so I have just one network wire into my hub that powers the Pi.</p> <p>I believe setting up <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/raspberrypi/\">Home Assistant on a Pi</a> is the best and easiest way to get started. That said, you can also run in a Docker Container, on a Synology or other NAS, or just on Windows or Mac in the background. It's up to you. Optionally, you can pay <a href=\"https://www.nabucasa.com/\">Nabu Casa</a> $5 for remote (outside your house) network access via transparent forwarding. But to be clear, it all still runs inside your house and not in the cloud.</p> <p><img title=\"Basic Home Assistant Setup\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Basic Home Assistant Setup\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Using-Home-Assistant_E31C/image_c613af81-10de-49d3-aead-6e174ca870ca.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"550\"></p> <p>OK, to the main point. I used to have an Amazon Ring Doorbell that would integrate with Amazon Alexa and when you pressed the doorbell it would say \"Someone is at the front door\" on our all Alexas. It was a lovely little integration that worked nicely in our lives.</p> <p><img title=\"Front Door UniFi G4 Doorbell\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Front Door UniFi G4 Doorbell\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Using-Home-Assistant_E31C/image_165ff623-cdc3-40c0-9caf-46686032f539.png\" width=\"485\" height=\"357\"></p> <p>However, I swapped out the Ring for a <a href=\"https://hacs.xyz/\">Unifi Protect G4 Doorbell</a> for a number of reasons. I don't want to pump video to outside services, so this doorbell integrates nicely with my <a href=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/review-unifi-from-ubiquiti-networking-is-the-ultimate-prosumer-home-networking-solution\">existing Unifi installation</a> and records video to a local hard drive. However, I lose any Alexa integration and this nice little \"someone is at the door\" announcement. So this seems like a perfect job for Home Assistant.</p> <p>Here's the general todo list:</p> <ul> <li>Install <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/\">Home Assistant</a></li> <li>Install <a href=\"https://hacs.xyz/\">Home Assistant Community Store</a></li> <ul> <li>This enables 3rd party \"untrusted\" integrations directly from GitHub. You'll need a GitHub account and it'll clone custom integrations directly into your local HA.</li> <li>I also recommend the Terminal &amp; SSH (9.2.2), File editor (5.3.3) add ons so you can see what's happening.</li></ul> <li>Get the <a href=\"https://github.com/briis/unifiprotect\">UniFi Protect 3rd party integration for Home Assistant</a></li> <ul> <li><strong>NOTE</strong>: Unifi Protect support is being promoted in Home Assistant v2022.2 so you won't need this step soon as it'll be included.</li> <li>\"The UniFi Protect Integration adds support for retrieving Camera feeds and Sensor data from a UniFi Protect installation on either an Ubiquiti CloudKey+, Ubiquiti UniFi Dream Machine Pro or UniFi Protect Network Video Recorder.\"</li> <li>Authenticate and configure this integration.</li></ul> <li>Get the <a href=\"https://github.com/custom-components/alexa_media_player\">Alexa Media Player</a> integration</li> <ul> <li>This makes all your Alexas show up in Home Assistant as \"media players\" and also allows you to tts (text to speech) to them.</li> <li>Authenticate and configure this integration.</li></ul></ul> <p>I recommend going into your Alexa app and making a Multi-room Speaker Group called \"everywhere.\" Not only because it's nice to be able to say \"play the music everywhere\" but you can also target that \"Everywhere\" group in Home Assistant.</p> <p>Go into your Home Assistant UI at <a title=\"http://homeassistant.local:8123/\" href=\"http://homeassistant.local:8123/\">http://homeassistant.local:8123/</a> and into <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/tools/dev-tools/\">Developer Tools</a>. Under Services, try pasting in this YAML and clicking \"call service.\"</p><pre>service: notify.alexa_media_everywhere\ndata:\n  message: Someone is at the front door, this is a test\n  data:\n    type: announce\n    method: speak</pre>\n<p>If that works, you know you can automate Alexa and make it say things. Now, go to Configuration, Automation, and Add a new Automation. Here's mine. I used the UI to create it. Note that your Entity names may be different if you give your front doorbell camera a different name.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Binary_sensor.front_door_doorbell\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Binary_sensor.front_door_doorbell\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Using-Home-Assistant_E31C/image_6c40ad44-b67e-422c-97c8-41741af21066.png\" width=\"404\" height=\"389\"></p>\n<p>Notice the format of Data, it's name value pairs within a single field's value.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Alexa Action\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Alexa Action\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Using-Home-Assistant_E31C/image_5a58a5af-dd88-40f5-9c62-93202dbdf409.png\" width=\"815\" height=\"682\"></p>\n<p>...but it also exists in a file called Automations.yaml.

So this seems like a perfect job for Home Assistant.</p> <p>Here's the general todo list:</p> <ul> <li>Install <a href=\"https://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/\">Home Assistant</a></li> <li>Install <a href=\"https://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://hacs.xyz/\">Home Assistant Community Store</a></li> <ul> <li>This enables 3rd party \"untrusted\" integrations directly from GitHub. You'll need a GitHub account and it'll clone custom integrations directly into your local HA.</li> <li>I also recommend the Terminal &amp; SSH (9.2.2), File editor (5.3.3) add ons so you can see what's happening.</li></ul> <li>Get the <a href=\"https://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://github.com/briis/unifiprotect\">UniFi Protect 3rd party integration for Home Assistant</a></li> <ul> <li><strong>NOTE</strong>: Unifi Protect support is being promoted in Home Assistant v2022.2 so you won't need this step soon as it'll be included.</li> <li>\"The UniFi Protect Integration adds support for retrieving Camera feeds and Sensor data from a UniFi Protect installation on either an Ubiquiti CloudKey+, Ubiquiti UniFi Dream Machine Pro or UniFi Protect Network Video Recorder.\"</li> <li>Authenticate and configure this integration.</li></ul> <li>Get the <a href=\"https://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://github.com/custom-components/alexa_media_player\">Alexa Media Player</a> integration</li> <ul> <li>This makes all your Alexas show up in Home Assistant as \"media players\" and also allows you to tts (text to speech) to them.</li> <li>Authenticate and configure this integration.</li></ul></ul> <p>I recommend going into your Alexa app and making a Multi-room Speaker Group called \"everywhere.\" Not only because it's nice to be able to say \"play the music everywhere\" but you can also target that \"Everywhere\" group in Home Assistant.</p> <p>Go into your Home Assistant UI at <a title=\"http://homeassistant.local:8123/\" href=\"https://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~homeassistant.local:8123/\">http://homeassistant.local:8123/</a> and into <a href=\"https://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/tools/dev-tools/\">Developer Tools</a>. Under Services, try pasting in this YAML and clicking \"call service.\"</p><pre>service: notify.alexa_media_everywhere\ndata:\n  message: Someone is at the front door, this is a test\n  data:\n    type: announce\n    method: speak</pre>\n<p>If that works, you know you can automate Alexa and make it say things. Now, go to Configuration, Automation, and Add a new Automation. Here's mine. I used the UI to create it. Note that your Entity names may be different if you give your front doorbell camera a different name.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Binary_sensor.front_door_doorbell\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Binary_sensor.front_door_doorbell\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Using-Home-Assistant_E31C/image_6c40ad44-b67e-422c-97c8-41741af21066.png\" width=\"404\" height=\"389\"></p>\n<p>Notice the format of Data, it's name value pairs within a single field's value.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Alexa Action\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Alexa Action\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Using-Home-Assistant_E31C/image_5a58a5af-dd88-40f5-9c62-93202dbdf409.png\" width=\"815\" height=\"682\"></p>\n<p>...but it also exists in a file called Automations.yaml. Note that the \"to: 'on'\" trigger is required or you'll get double announcements, one for <em>each state change </em>in the doorbell. </p><pre>- id: '1640995128073'\n  alias: G4 Doorbell Announcement with Alexa\n  description: G4 Doorbell Announcement with Alexa\n  trigger:\n  - platform: state\n    entity_id: binary_sensor.front_door_doorbell\n    to: 'on'\n  condition: []\n  action:\n  - service: notify.alexa_media_everywhere\n    data:\n      data:\n        type: announce\n        method: speak\n      message: Someone is at the front door\n  mode: single</pre>\n<p>It works! There's a ton of cool stuff I can automate now!</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Sponsor:</strong> Make login Auth0’s problem. Not yours.

It would definitely need to communicate \"back home\" to the runner which is either \"dotnet watch\" or VS2022.</p>\n<p>If I change the ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT to \"Production\" (either via launch.json, launchsettings, or an environment variable like this, I can see that extra HotReload helper script isn't there:</p><pre>C:\\github\\wshotreloadtest&gt;dotnet run --environment=\"Production\"<br>Building...<br>info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]<br>      Now listening on: https://localhost:7216<br>info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]<br>      Now listening on: <a href=\"http://localhost:5216\">http://localhost:5216</a></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Remember: </strong>You never want to use dotnet run in production! It's an SDK building command! You'll want to use dotnet exec your.dll, dotnet your.dll, or best of all, in .NET 6 just call the EXE directly! .\\bin\\Debug\\net6.0\\wshotreloadtest.exe in my example. Why? dotnet run will always assume it's in Development (you literally tell it to restore, build, and exec in one run command) if you run it. You'll note that running the actual EXE is always WAY faster as well! Don't ship your .NET SDK to your webserver and don't recompile the whole thing on startup in production!</p></blockquote>\n<p>We can see that that aspnnetcore-browser-refresh.js is the client side of Development-time HotReload.

It would definitely need to communicate \"back home\" to the runner which is either \"dotnet watch\" or VS2022.</p>\n<p>If I change the ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT to \"Production\" (either via launch.json, launchsettings, or an environment variable like this, I can see that extra HotReload helper script isn't there:</p><pre>C:\\github\\wshotreloadtest&gt;dotnet run --environment=\"Production\"\n<br>Building...\n<br>info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]\n<br>      Now listening on: https://localhost:7216\n<br>info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]\n<br>      Now listening on: <a href=\"http://localhost:5216\">http://localhost:5216</a></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Remember: </strong>You never want to use dotnet run in production! It's an SDK building command! You'll want to use dotnet exec your.dll, dotnet your.dll, or best of all, in .NET 6 just call the EXE directly! .\\bin\\Debug\\net6.0\\wshotreloadtest.exe in my example. Why? dotnet run will always assume it's in Development (you literally tell it to restore, build, and exec in one run command) if you run it. You'll note that running the actual EXE is always WAY faster as well! Don't ship your .NET SDK to your webserver and don't recompile the whole thing on startup in production!</p></blockquote>\n<p>We can see that that aspnnetcore-browser-refresh.js is the client side of Development-time HotReload. Looking at our browser console we see :</p>\n<p><img title=\"Refused to Connect because it violates a CSP Directive\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Refused to Connect because it violates a CSP Directive\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/72550dc07007_14F70/image_1f22b882-9a3f-4fad-b201-fb0f26c86db6.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"159\"></p><pre>Refused to connect to 'wss://localhost:62486/' \n<br>because it violates the following Content Security Policy \n<br>directive: \"default-src 'self'\". \n<br>Note that 'connect-src' was not explicitly set, \n<br>so 'default-src' is used as a fallback.</pre>\n<p>That's a lot to think about. I started out my ASP.NET Web App's middle ware saying it was OK to talk \"back to myself\" but nowhere else. </p><pre>app.UseCsp(options =&gt; options.DefaultSources(s =&gt; s.Self())); </pre>\n<p>Hm, self seems reasonable, why can't the browser connect BACK to the dotnet run'ed Kestrel Web Server? It's all localhost, right? Well, specifically it's http://localhost not ws://localhost, or even wss://localhost (that extra s is for secure) so I need to explicitly allow ws: or wss: or both, but only in Development.</p>\n<p>Maybe like this (again, I'm using NWebSpec, but these are just HTTP Headers so you can literally just add them if you want, hardcoded.)</p><pre class=\"brush: csharp; gutter: false; toolbar: false; auto-links: false; smart-tabs: false;\">app.UseCsp(options =&gt; options.DefaultSources(s =&gt; s.Self())\n<br>            .ConnectSources(s =&gt; s.CustomSources(\"wss://localhost:62895\")));\n</pre>\n<p>But port numbers change, right? Let's do just wss:, only in Development. Now, if I'm using both CSPs and WebSockets (ws:, wss:) in Production, I'll need to be intentional about this.</p>\n<p>What's the moral?</p>\n<p><strong>If you start using CSP Headers to tighten things up, be conscious and aware of the headers you need for conveniences like Hot Reload in Development versus whatever things you may need in Production. </strong></p>\n<p>Hope this helps save you some time!</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Sponsor: </strong>At Rocket Mortgage® the work you do around here will be 100% impactful but won’t take all your free time, giving you the perfect work-life balance.
