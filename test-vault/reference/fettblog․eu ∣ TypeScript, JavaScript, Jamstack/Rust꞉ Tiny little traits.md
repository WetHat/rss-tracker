Itâ€™s so much fun and so useful, though!

Rustâ€™s trait system has a feature that is often talked about, but which I donâ€™t see used that often in application code: Implementing your traits for types that are not yours. You can see this a lot in the standard library, and also in some libraries (hello [`itertools`](https://docs.rs/itertools/latest/itertools/)), but I see developers shy away from doing that when writing applications. Itâ€™s so much fun and so useful, though!
