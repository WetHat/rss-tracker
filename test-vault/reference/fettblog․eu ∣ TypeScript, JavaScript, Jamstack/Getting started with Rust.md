Interest in the Rust programming language has brought me to [found the Rust Linz meetup with Rainer Stropek](https://rust-linz.at), to teach [Rust at the local university](https://rust-jku.netlify.app), and to do [a ton](/slides/idiomatic-rust) [of workshops](/network-applications-with-tokio-and-rust/) on the topic.
