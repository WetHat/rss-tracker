He's an amazing speaker and combines true \"Berliner Schnauze\" with a lot of interesting information. Have fun in Amsterdam, pal, see you in D&uuml;sseldorf at the latest!</p>"

Planting fresh ideas into bright brains. Seeding energizing motivation into otherwise boring \"business as usual\". Throwing a spotlight on fields which are closely linked to our own work, yet rarely part of our considerations. In other words, the principles of the Netural environment get blown up to a full-size conference here.</p>"
