> [!abstract] JSX is syntactic sugar - 2018-11-21T00:00:00.000Z
> If you follow me you know that Iâ€™m super late to the React game. It was not until functional components showed up that I got really interested in the framework. I just loved the idea of having everything wrapped in an easy function rather than needing to navigate up and down a class to get everything together. One thing that put me off in the beginning though was JSX. And Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™m not the only one. Every time I talk to people about my newly found React love, this point comes up constantly.
