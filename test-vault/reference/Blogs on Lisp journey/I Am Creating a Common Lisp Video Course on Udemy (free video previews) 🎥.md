Everyone, let me celebrate a little bit: I am creating a Common Lisp video course on the Udemy platform. I’m several dozen hours in already and it’s taking a good shape! It is so much more time consuming to create videos than to write a tutorial O_o But I like what’s in there already, although there isn’t everything I want to teach, of course. I’m working on more content. Everything will come in time, and meanwhile you can buy the course: you’ll get future content for “free” ;) Yes the course is to sell, hopefully it will help me concentrate more on my CL activities (BTW, dear reader, here’s a 50% off coupon for April, 2022, and if you are a student drop me a line).
