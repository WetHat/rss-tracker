> [!abstract] Lisp for the web: building one standalone binary with foreign libraries, templates and static assets - 2022-11-28T17:43:43.000Z
> In our previous entry, we saw how to deploy our web application with Systemd, either from sources or with a binary. Now weâ€™ll speak more about this building process to produce one binary that contains everything for our web app. Weâ€™ll tackle 3 issues: ship foreign libraries alongside your binary, such as libreadline.so or libsqlite3.so, include your Djula templates into your binary, serve static files from your binary, without reading the filesystem, and weâ€™ll see my Gitlab CI recipe.
