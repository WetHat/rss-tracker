> Djula is a Common Lisp port of the Django templating language. Itâ€™s good, itâ€™s proven (itâ€™s one of the most downloaded Quicklisp packages), it is easy to use and it has good documentation. It basically looks like this: {% extends "base.html" %} {% block title %}Memberlist{% endblock %} {% block content %} <ul> {% for user in users %} <li><a href="{{ user.url }}">{{ user.username }}</a></li> {% endfor %} </ul> {% endblock %} What was missing in the documentation was how to create custom filters.
