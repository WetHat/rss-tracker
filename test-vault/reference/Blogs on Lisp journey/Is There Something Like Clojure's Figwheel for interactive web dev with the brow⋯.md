> [!abstract] Is There Something Like Clojure's Figwheel for interactive web dev with the browser in Common Lisp ? - 2017-05-04T10:32:01.000Z
> Looks like there is: trident-mode, an “Emacs minor mode for live Parenscript interaction”, based on skewer but: trident-mode doesn’t seem to be used in the wild (while skewer-mode is) and I don’t know Figwheel so all I can say is that it seems a bit different: instead of letting us selectively evaluate and send code to the browser, Figwheels seems to rebuild the entire project and send the result when we write a file.
