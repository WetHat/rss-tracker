Hereâ€™s an enhanced page for the Cookbook: https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/functions.html Only the Currying part was untouched (we enhanced it already), the higher-order functions part existed and was rewritten. The rest is new, and it should help you start writing Common Lisp quicker than ever. Happy lisping ! Table of Contents Named functions: defun Arguments Base case: required arguments Optional arguments: &optional Named parameters: &key Mixing optional and key parameters Default values Variable number of arguments: &rest &allow-other-keys Return values Multiple return values: values and multiple-value-bind Anonymous functions: lambda Calling functions programatically: funcall and apply Higher order functions: functions that return functions Closures setf functions Currying Concept With the Alexandria library Documentation Named functions: defun Creating named functions is done with the defun keyword.
