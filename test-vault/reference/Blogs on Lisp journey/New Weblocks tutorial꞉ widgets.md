> Weblocks is a web framework, created circa 2007, that allows to write dynamic web applications in full Lisp, without a line of Javascript. It is based on so called widgets, that are rendered server-side and updated on the client, and it was also based on continuations (they were removed in this fork, at least for now). It was quietly being forgotten but it is being fixed, refactored, documented and simplified by Alexander “svetlyak40wt” since a year or so.
