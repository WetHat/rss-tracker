A few weeks ago, I put together a new Lisp video. Itâ€™s cool, sound on, â€˜til the end ;) I want to show how to (quickly) do practical, real-world stuff in Lisp. Here, how to request a web API.

I develop in Emacs with Slime, but in the end we also build a binary, so we have a little application that works on the command line (note that I didnâ€™t use SBCLâ€™s core compression, we could have a lighter binary of around 30MB).
