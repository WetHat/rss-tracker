Hey, pardon this very short post, itâ€™s just for the pleasure of blogging, and to balance the usual lengthy ones. I wanted to commit, one by one, every file of the current directory (itâ€™s useless, donâ€™t ask). I use legit as the interface to Git, and this one-liner: (dolist (file (uiop:directory-files "./")) (legit:git-add :paths (pathname file)) (legit:git-commit :files (pathname file) :message (format nil "add ~a" (file-namestring file)))) I guessed the :paths and :files arguments with Slimeâ€™s command argument list which appears in the modline, I wanted a function to convert a /full/path/file.
