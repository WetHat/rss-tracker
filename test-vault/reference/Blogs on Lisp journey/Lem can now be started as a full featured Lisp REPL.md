The Lem editor, which supports Common Lisp as well as other languages, works by default in the terminal with a ncurses frontend (it also has an experimental Electron frontend). It ships a nice Lisp REPL: it has good fuzzy completion, enough keyboard shortcuts, an interactive debugger, a completion menu, etc. It is now possible to run Lem straight in its Lisp REPL. Run it with: lem --eval "(lem-lisp-mode:start-lisp-repl t)" The optional argument (t) was added recently (thanks, @cxxxr) and allows to start the REPL in fullscreen.
