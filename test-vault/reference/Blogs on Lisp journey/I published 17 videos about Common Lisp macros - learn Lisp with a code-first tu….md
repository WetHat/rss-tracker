For those who don’t know and who didn’t see the banner :D I am creating a Common Lisp course on the Udemy platform (with complementary videos on Youtube). I wanted to do something different and complementary than writing on the Cookbook. I worked on new videos this summer and I just finished editing the subtitles. I have added 17 videos (worth 1h30+ of code-driven content) about Common Lisp macros!
