> [!abstract] Writing an interactive web app in Common Lisp: Hunchentoot then CLOG - 2022-04-28T13:23:14.000Z
> We want a web app to display a list of data and have an input field to interactively filter it. Weâ€™ll start with a simple, regular web app built with Hunchentoot. Weâ€™ll have a search input to filter our data, and weâ€™ll see that to be more interactive, typically to filter out the results as the user types, weâ€™ll need more than basic HTTP requests. Weâ€™ll need some JavaScript. But weâ€™ll reach this level of interactivity with CLOG (and no JavaScript).
