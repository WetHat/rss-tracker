## Lambda expressions define functions

A lambda expression looks like this:

`>>> square = lambda n:                                 n**2`
                                

This `square` variable [points](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/pointers/) to some object now. What do you think its _type_ might be?

`>>> type(square)                                 <class 'function'>`
                                

It's a function!

We could [call this function](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/calling-a-function/) just like any other function in Python:

`>>> square(3)                                 9`
                                

A lambda expression is a way of making a function. And a lambda function is the object we get back from a lambda expression:

`>>> square                                 <function <lambda> at                                 0x7f7f221eaca0>`
                                

But wait... don't we already have a syntax for making functions in Python?

We do and you've probably seen it many times before:

`def square(n):                                 return n**2`
                                

We can use this `def` syntax for [defining a new function](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/making-a-function/).

So why do lambda expressions exist?

## Lambda expressions can be defined on the same line they're used

Let's say we'd like to â€¦
