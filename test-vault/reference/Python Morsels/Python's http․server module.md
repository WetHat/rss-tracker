Use Python's `http.server` module to serve up a static website on your own machine.

## A directory trees of `index.html` files

We have a directory here that represents a static website:

`~/comprehensions/_build/dirhtml                                 $ ls index.html                                 index.html`
                                

We not only have an `index.html` file, but also a bunch of sub-directories, each with their own `index.html` file:

`~/comprehensions/_build/dirhtml                                 $ ls generator-expressions                                 index.html`
                                

The only way to really navigate this website locally is to **serve up these files** using some sort of HTTP server that is aware of these index files.

Python comes bundled with an HTTP server that we can use. It's called `http.server`.

## Serving up HTML files with `http.server`

If we run this module â€¦
