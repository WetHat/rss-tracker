## What is a context manager?

A [context manager](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/what-is-a-context-manager/) is **an object that can be used in a `with` block** to sandwich some code between an entrance action and an exit action.

File objects can be used as context managers to _automatically_ close the file when we're done working with it:

`>>> with open("example.txt", "w")                                 as file:                                 ...  file.write("Hello,                                 world!")                                 ...                                 13                                 >>>                                 file.closed                                 True`
                                

Context managers need a `__enter__` method and a `__exit__` method, and the `__exit__` method should accept three [positional arguments](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/positional-vs-keyword-arguments/):

`class Example:                                 def __enter__(self):                                 print("enter")                                  def __exit__(self,                                 exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):                                 print("exit")`
                                

This context manager just prints `enter` when the `with` block is entered and `exit` when the `with` block is exited:

`>>> with Example():                                 ...  print("Yay                                 Python!")                                 ...                                 enter                                 Yay Python!                                 exit`
                                

Of course, this is a somewhat silly context manager. Let's look at a context manager that actually does something a little bit useful.
