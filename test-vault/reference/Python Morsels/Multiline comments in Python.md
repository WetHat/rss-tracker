Python does not have multiline comments. But you can use alternatives like docstrings, editor shortcuts, and conventional commenting methods, depending on your requirements.

## Does Python have multi-line comments?

For single-line comments, Python uses the octothorpe character (`#`), also known as pound, number sign, crunch, and of course, the hashtag character:

`# This is a comment  this = "is not a comment"`

But what if you want to comment out **a whole block** of code?

Unlike some programming languages, Python does _not_ have multi-line comments.

## What about triple quotes?

You might be thinking, wait, â€¦
