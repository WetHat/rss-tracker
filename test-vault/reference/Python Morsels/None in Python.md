Python's `None` value is used to represent nothingness. `None` is the default function return value.

## Python's `None` value

Python has a special object that's typically **used for representing nothingness**. It's called `None`.

If we look at `None` from [the Python REPL](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/using-the-python-repl/), we'll see nothing at all:

`>>> name =                                 None                                 >>>`
                                

Though if we print it, we'll see `None`:

`>>> name =                                 None                                 >>>                                 name                                 >>>                                 print(name)                                 None`
                                

When checking for `None` values, you'll usually see Python's `is` operator used (for [identity](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/equality-vs-identity/)) instead of the equality operator (`==`):

`>>> name is None                                 True                                 >>>                                 name == None                                 True`
                                

Why is that?

Well, **`None` has its own special type**, the `NoneType`, and it's **the only object of that type**:

`>>> type(None)                                 <class 'NoneType'>`
                                

In fact, if we got a reference to that `NoneType` [class](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/classes-are-everywhere/), and then we called that class to make a new instance of it, we'll actually get back the same exact instance, always, every time we call it:

`>>> NoneType = type(None)                                 >>>                                 NoneType() is                                 None                                 True`
                                

The `NoneType` class is a **[singleton class](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/making-singletons/)**. So comparing to `None` with `is` works because there's only one `None` value. No object should compare as equal to None unless it is `None`.

## `None` is falsey

We often rely on the â€¦
