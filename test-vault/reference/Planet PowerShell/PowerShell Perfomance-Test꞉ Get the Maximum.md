### Introduction:

Efficiency is key when working with PowerShell, and maximizing performance is a common goal for script developers. In this post, we'll explore various techniques for retrieving the maximum number from arrays of different sizes, comparing well-known approaches like Measure-Object, Sort-Object and a more mathematical method.

### Methods:

1. #### Measure-Object:
    

To retrieve the maximum number using Measure-Object, the following command is used:

```
(@(1,3,55,69,13,37)| Measure-Object -Maximum).Maximum 
```

2. #### Sort-Object:
    

Another approach involves sorting the array and extracting the highest number from the last index:

```
(@(1,3,55,69,13,37)| Sort-Object)[-1]
```

3. #### Mathematical Approach:
    

Utilizing the [System.Math] class and its Max method requires a loop through the array:

```
$Numbers = (@(1,3,55,69,13,37)
$maxValue = $Numbers[0] #rss/we need to start with an number
foreach($num in $Numbers){
    $maxValue = [System.Math]::Max($Num,$maxValue)
}
```

### Performance Testing:

For a comprehensive performance comparison, three arrays of different sizes were created:

```
$NumbersLarge   = get-random -min 0 -max 1gb -count 20mb
$NumbersMedium  = get-random -min 0 -max 1gb -count 1mb
$NumbersSmall   = get-random -min 0 -max 1gb -count 100kb
```

### Results:

#### Small List:

```
Technique Time            RelativeSpeed Throughput
--------- ----            ------------- ----------
Math      00:00:00.144915 1x            34.5/s
Measure   00:00:00.602446 4.16x         8.3/s
Sort      00:00:02.053357 14.17x        2.44/s
```

#### Medium List:

```
Technique Time            RelativeSpeed Throughput
--------- ----            ------------- ----------
Math      00:00:01.377477 1x            3.63/s
Measure   00:00:11.163644 8.1x          0.45/s
Sort      00:00:31.034414 22.53x        0.16/s
```

#### Large List:

```
Technique Time            RelativeSpeed Throughput
--------- ----            ------------- ----------
Math      00:00:26.392599 1x            0.19/s
Measure   00:01:57.695910 4.46x         0.04/s
Sort      00:18:38.731559 42.39x        0/s
```

### Conclusion:

The [System.Math]::Max() method consistently outperforms Measure-Object and Sort-Object, particularly for larger datasets. Although its implementation may be less intuitive, encapsulating it in a function enhances usability.

### Function Implementation:

```
function Get-MaxNumber {
    param (
        [int[]]Numbers
    )
    $MaxValue = $Numbers[0]
    foreach($num in $Numbers){
        $MaxValue = [System.Math]::Max($MaxValue,$num)
    }
    return $MaxValue
}
```

In scenarios where milliseconds matter and the primary goal is to retrieve the maximum number, the targeted solution using [System.Math]::Max() proves to be a powerful choice.
