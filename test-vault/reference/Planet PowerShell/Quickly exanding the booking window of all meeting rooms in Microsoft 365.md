> [!abstract] Quickly exanding the booking window of all meeting rooms in Microsoft 365 - 2024-02-08T00:00:00.000Z
> So I got a task to expand the booking window for all the meeting rooms at work. From the default 180 days to 365 days. This isnâ€™t anything big or complicated to do. Itâ€™s an everyday task really. But I was wondering, how short can I make the PowerShell script to do this for all meeting rooms?
