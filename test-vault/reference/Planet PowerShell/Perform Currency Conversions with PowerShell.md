> [!abstract] Perform Currency Conversions with PowerShell by mark@wragg.io - 2024-02-08T13:30:00.000Z
> Iâ€™ve recently been working on a PowerShell module for exploring Azure costs and while doing so added some functionality to allow the costs to be converted between different currencies. It occurred to me that this functionality would be useful as a module of its own, and when I searched around I didnâ€™t find too many recent examples for the same. As such Iâ€™ve now developed and published a module in the PowerShell Gallery and on GitHub called CurrencyConverter.
