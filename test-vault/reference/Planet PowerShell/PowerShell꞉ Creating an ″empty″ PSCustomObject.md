## Simplifying Creation of Empty PowerShell PSCustomObjects using Custom Functions

Creating an empty PSCustomObject in PowerShell is a common task, but the traditional approach can be verbose and repetitive. In this blog post, I'll walk you through a more structured and efficient way to achieve this using functions and property definitions.

## The Traditional Approach

Frequently, developers, including myself, create empty PSCustomObjects like this:

```
[PSCustomObject]@{
    Name = $null
    DisplayName = $null
    Telephone = $null
    EmailAddress = $null
    Gender = $null
    Street = $null
    City = $null
}
```

While this method works, it can become unwieldy, especially when dealing with multiple properties. It consumes screen space and lacks a clear structure.

## A Structured Solution

To address these concerns, I devised a more organized approach using a custom function New-EmptyCustomObject. This function streamlines the process of creating empty PSCustomObjects and allows for greater flexibility.

```
function New-EmptyCustomObject {
    param (
        [string[]]$PropertyNames
    )
    
    $customObject = [PSCustomObject]@{}
    $customObject | Select-Object -Property $PropertyNames
}
```

By utilizing this function, you can now create empty objects in a more organized manner:

```
$propertyDefinitions = @{
    Users = @(
        "FirstName", "LastName", "UserName", "Title", "Department",
        "StreetAddress", "City", "State", "PostalCode", "Country",
        "PhoneNumber", "MobilePhone", "UsageLocation", "License"
    )
    Groups = @(
        "DisplayName", "PrimarySMTP", "Description", "Owner", "Type"
    )
    JobRole = @(
        "DisplayName", "PrimarySMTP", "Description", "Type"
    )
}

$usersObject  = New-EmptyCustomObject -PropertyNames $propertyDefinitions.Users
$groupsObject = New-EmptyCustomObject -PropertyNames $propertyDefinitions.Groups
$RoleObject   = New-EmptyCustomObject -PropertyNames $propertyDefinitions.JobRole

```

With this approach, you effortlessly generate empty PSCustomObjects while maintaining clear property definitions. This ensures that you can easily manage and track the properties of each PSCustomObject.

## Wrapping Up

In conclusion, the streamlined technique I've presented enhances the creation of empty PSCustomObjects by utilizing a custom function and well-defined property definitions. This method is not only efficient but also helps maintain a structured and organized codebase.
