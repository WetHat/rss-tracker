In the realm of PowerShell, determining the version of the operating system is a common task for sysadmins. However, when it comes to reporting, extracting additional details, such as the Update Build Release (UBR), becomes crucial. While the Winver tool is a popular choice for obtaining the build, including the UBR, PowerShell provides a more versatile approach.

### Unveiling the UBR: Going Beyond the Basics

#### Registry Magic

One way to retrieve the UBR is through the registry:

###### PowerShell:

```
(Get-ItemProperty 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion' â€“Name UBR).UBR
```

###### Output:

```
3570
```

This straightforward command quickly fetches the UBR, but what if you need more comprehensive information?

#### Exploring Get-ComputerInfo

To delve deeper into the operating system details, the Get-ComputerInfo command is a powerful tool. Specifically, the 'OsHardwareAbstractionLayer' property contains the complete string with the UBR:

###### PowerShell:

```
(Get-ComputerInfo).OsHardwareAbstractionLayer
```

###### Output:

```
10.0.19041.3570
```

##### Harnessing the [System.Version] Class

For a structured representation of the version information, the [System.Version] class proves invaluable. While [System.Environment]::OSVersion.Version provides the basics, including Major, Minor, Build, and Revision, it lacks the UBR. To include the UBR, cast the 'OsHardwareAbstractionLayer' property:

###### PowerShell:

```
[Version](Get-ComputerInfo).OsHardwareAbstractionLayer
```

###### Output:

```
Major  Minor  Build  Revision
-----  -----  -----  --------
10     0      19041  3570
```

Now, the output displays the detailed version information, including the UBR.

### Scaling Up: Managing Multiple Systems

But what if you're dealing with multiple computers? PowerShell offers a solution. Introducing Microsoft Graph, and if you are leveraging Intune, you can seamlessly fetch information from the cloud:

###### PowerShell:

```
import-module microsoft.graph.devicemanagement
[Version](Get-MGDeviceManagementManagedDevice -Filter "deviceName eq 'YouNameIt'").OSVersion
```

###### Output:

```
Major  Minor  Build  Revision
-----  -----  -----  --------
10     0      19041  3570
```

This method enables you to obtain the necessary information from the cloud with a simple Microsoft Graph call, making it especially handy for managing multiple devices efficiently.

#### Building Your PowerShell Toolbelt

In conclusion, by combining registry queries, Get-ComputerInfo, and the [System.Version] class, you've crafted a robust toolkit for extracting detailed operating system information. Whether you're working on a single machine or managing an entire fleet of devices through the cloud, PowerShell equips you with the flexibility to streamline your patching processes.
