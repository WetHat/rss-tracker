> [!abstract] Report from which PowerShell module the cmdlets are from by Harm Veenstra - 2024-04-18T17:09:01.000Z
> We all encountered this: you get a script or function that uses a certain cmdlet... And it fails because the cmdlet is not recognized :( But which module should you install to get the script working? Or does your script install or import all the required modules? In this blog post, I will show you how to check from which module(s) the cmdlet(s) originate and if they are present on your system or if you should install them.
