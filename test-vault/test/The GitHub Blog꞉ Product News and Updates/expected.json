This new addition to our suite of hosted runners provides power, performance and sustainability improvements for all your GitHub Actions jobs. Developers can now take advantage of Arm-based hardware hosted by GitHub to build and deploy their release assets anywhere Arm architecture is used. Best of all, these runners are priced at 37% less than our x64 Linux and Windows runners.</p>\n<p>Customers are refactoring their applications to take advantage of the price and performance benefits of Arm architecture. These new runners provide power, performance, and sustainability improvements for all your GitHub Actions jobs and are designed to efficiently run large cloud-native workloads. Developers in every industry&mdash;from gaming to embedded mobile development&mdash;are able to take advantage of the performance these new runners offer.</p>\n<p>These runners are fully managed by GitHub with an image built by Arm containing all the tools needed for developers to get started. They offer a power-efficient compute layer that can increase price-to-performance ratios, allowing customers to optimize compute costs to get more done within existing budgets while also reducing their carbon footprint.</p>\n<p>Previously, developers building on Arm within GitHub have had to self-host or utilize QEMU virtualization which is slower than running natively. Customers can now build, test, and deploy their web and application servers, open-source databases, containers, microservices, Java and .NET applications, AI applications, gaming, or media servers on the Arm architecture, bringing their entire CI/CD workflow onto one platform while also benefiting from the scale and speed gained from using GitHub-hosted runners.</p>\n<figure class=\"gh-full-blockquote mx-0 pl-6 mt-6 mt-md-7 mb-7 mb-md-8\"><blockquote><p>We leveraged Arm runners to very quickly set up a workflow to build a Linux Arm64 binary for our open source Rust project, Spice.ai OSS, and it&rsquo;s been rock-solid&ndash;we haven&rsquo;t had any issues with it since we set it up. We&rsquo;ve saved 2-3 days of engineering effort up front to set up our own runners, plus about 1-2 hours per week to maintain them ourselves.</p></blockquote><figcaption class=\"text-mono color-fg-muted f5-mktg mt-3\"> - Phillip LeBlanc // Founder and CTO, Spice AI</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"github-and-arm-a-new-class-of-image\" id=\"github-and-arm-a-new-class-of-image\" >GitHub and Arm: A new class of image<a href=\"#github-and-arm-a-new-class-of-image\" class=\"heading-link pl-2 text-italic text-bold\" aria-label=\"GitHub and Arm: A new class of image\"></a></h2>\n<p>GitHub has partnered with Arm to provide the Ubuntu and Windows VM images for these runners, ensuring our customers can seamlessly start building on Arm. The Ubuntu 22.04 image is equipped with a full set of tools to jumpstart developers quickly on Arm runners and begin deploying Arm release assets as soon as possible, with plans to add developer tools to the Windows image and a new Ubuntu 24.04 image.</p>\n<p>GitHub is excited to present these partner images to our customers. We are committed to partnering with the best technology providers on the market to provide a wide range of images for our customers to build on. These partnerships are focused on providing a best-in-class experience that can be leveraged across industries. We began this with our GPU runners, launched in April, by offering an image built by NVIDIA aimed at companies wanting to incorporate their MLOps practices into GitHub Actions. As we expand our GitHub-hosted runner fleet, we will continue to expand image options in parallel through close partnerships with industry-leading technology providers.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Our longstanding partnership with GitHub is rooted in empowering shift-left software development and accelerating time to market while improving sustainability,&rdquo; said Bhumik Patel, Director of Software Ecosystem Development, Infrastructure Line of Business at Arm. &ldquo;The availability of Arm-hosted runners marks an important step toward more sustainable computing by enabling software developers with advanced CI/CD capabilities to develop the power-efficient and versatile Arm architecture for projects, from data centers and cloud to automotive, IoT, and much more.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>To view the list of installed software, give feedback, or report issues with the image, head to the new <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/partner-runner-images\">partner runner images repository</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sustainability-on-github-actions\" id=\"sustainability-on-github-actions\" >Sustainability on GitHub Actions<a href=\"#sustainability-on-github-actions\" class=\"heading-link pl-2 text-italic text-bold\" aria-label=\"Sustainability on GitHub Actions\"></a></h2>\n<p>GitHub is committed to sustainability, and to helping customers on their journey to reduce their own carbon emissions. By using these new Arm-hosted runners, customers can lower their carbon footprint by running on machines that are proven to be more power efficient. Arm-based servers in the cloud have been shown to use 30-40% less power output for some of the most widely deployed workloads. [<a href=\"https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/insights/focus/will-java-run-more-sustainably-on-arms-architecture#:~:text=The%20higher%20power%20efficiency%20of,critical%20reporting%20metrics%20for%20corporations\">Source</a>, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2023/03/01/ampere-is-driving-sustainability-using-the-right-metricpower-at-the-rack/?sh=41e3613e2ed9\">source</a>]</p>\n<p>Arm technology has been shown to reduce heat generation and lower power consumption in data centers. To help understand your own impact, you can <a href=\"https://github.com/green-coding-solutions/eco-ci-energy-estimation\">use this tool</a> to measure the energy consumption of each of your GitHub Actions workflow runs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"get-started-using-arm-hosted-runners-today\" id=\"get-started-using-arm-hosted-runners-today\" >Get started using Arm-hosted runners today!<a href=\"#get-started-using-arm-hosted-runners-today\" class=\"heading-link pl-2 text-italic text-bold\" aria-label=\"Get started using Arm-hosted runners today!\"></a></h2>\n<p>These runners are available to our customers on our GitHub Team and Enterprise Cloud plans. We expect to begin offering Arm runners for open source projects by the end of the year. Customers can begin using these runners today by creating an Arm runner in their organization/enterprise, and then updating the <code>runs-on</code> syntax in their GitHub Actions workflow file to call that runner name.

We found that our AI pair programmer helps developers code up to <a href=\"https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/\">55% faster</a> and that it made <a href=\"https://github.blog/2023-10-10-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-code-quality/\">85% of developers</a> feel more confident in their code quality. With the introduction of our first <a href=\"https://github.blog/2023-02-14-github-copilot-for-business-is-now-available/\">GitHub Copilot offering for businesses and organizations in 2023</a>&mdash;and more recently <a href=\"https://github.blog/2024-02-27-github-copilot-enterprise-is-now-generally-available/#:~:text=Our%20most%20advanced%20AI%20offering,throughout%20the%20software%20development%20lifecycle.\">GitHub Copilot Enterprise</a>&mdash;it&rsquo;s become increasingly important for us to measure the impact of GitHub Copilot across real-world, large engineering organizations.</p>\n<p><strong>To learn more, we partnered with Accenture to study how developers integrated GitHub Copilot into their daily workflows</strong>, and we found significant improvements in several areas, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improved developer satisfaction.</strong> 90% of developers found they were more fulfilled with their job when using GitHub Copilot, and 95% said they enjoyed coding more with Copilot&rsquo;s help.</li>\n<li><strong>Quickly adopted by developers.</strong> Over 80% of Accenture participants successfully adopted GitHub Copilot with a 96% success rate among initial users. 43% found it &ldquo;extremely easy to use.&rdquo; Additionally, 67% of total participants used GitHub Copilot at least 5 days per week, averaging 3.4 days of usage weekly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"methodology\" id=\"methodology\" >Methodology<a href=\"#methodology\" class=\"heading-link pl-2 text-italic text-bold\" aria-label=\"Methodology\"></a></h2>\n<p>In this study, we collaborated with Accenture to conduct an extensive, randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants included developers who engage in a variety of software development tasks daily, including engineering, design, and testing across a spectrum of software products and services. They hold various positions within their organizations from entry-level roles to team management positions, and may work collaboratively or independently depending on the project and team dynamics.</p>\n<p>For the trial, developers were randomly assigned to two groups. One group of developers was given access to GitHub Copilot, while the other group was not. Our objective was to assess the influence of GitHub Copilot on developers&rsquo; experience within the enterprise setting, where they collaborate on multifaceted projects. We collected DevOps telemetry on several output performance metrics that reflect insights into developers&rsquo; regular coding activity.</p>\n<p>Beyond the initial experiment, we conducted a company-wide adoption analysis, which explored installation rates, generated code acceptance rates, and the time it took developers to accept GitHub Copilot&rsquo;s first coding suggestion. Success was determined by whether they accepted a suggestion from GitHub Copilot or not.</p>\n<p>In addition, we surveyed the GitHub Copilot users at Accenture to gain a better understanding of how developers perceived the impact of GitHub Copilot on their workflows. Not only did this survey uncover insights into how and when developers are using GitHub Copilot, but it also indicated an overwhelming improvement in developer satisfaction, which we know to be a key component of the <a href=\"https://github.blog/2023-06-08-developer-experience-what-is-it-and-why-should-you-care/\">developer experience (DevEx)</a>. The combination of both telemetry data and the information from the survey provides a full picture for us to understand GitHub Copilot&rsquo;s impact at the enterprise level.</p>\n<h2 id=\"our-findings\" id=\"our-findings\" >Our findings<a href=\"#our-findings\" class=\"heading-link pl-2 text-italic text-bold\" aria-label=\"Our findings\"></a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"developers-quickly-found-value-in-github-copilot-and-adopted-it-as-part-of-their-daily-toolkit\" id=\"developers-quickly-found-value-in-github-copilot-and-adopted-it-as-part-of-their-daily-toolkit\" >Developers quickly found value in GitHub Copilot and adopted it as part of their daily toolkit<a href=\"#developers-quickly-found-value-in-github-copilot-and-adopted-it-as-part-of-their-daily-toolkit\" class=\"heading-link pl-2 text-italic text-bold\" aria-label=\"Developers quickly found value in GitHub Copilot and adopted it as part of their daily toolkit\"></a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2024/earnings-fy-2024-q2.aspx\">More than 50,000 organizations have adopted GitHub Copilot so far</a>, but we haven&rsquo;t yet had a clear view into what those adoption rates look like on the individual level. When we dug deeper into the usage patterns of GitHub Copilot among Accenture developers, <strong>67% of respondents reported utilizing GitHub Copilot at least 5 days per week</strong>, with an <strong>average usage frequency of 3.4 days per week.</strong> Moreover, a substantial 70% of respondents relied on GitHub Copilot for coding tasks in a familiar programming language. This indicates a high level of integration of GitHub Copilot into developers&rsquo; daily workflows, highlighting its importance as a valuable engineering tool and resource.</p>\n<p>We also observed that developers were excited to use GitHub Copilot. <strong>81.4% of developers installed the GitHub Copilot IDE extension on the same day</strong> that they received a license. And not only were they excited to use it, but getting started was simple and did not provide a barrier to entry.</p>\n<p>In fact, <strong>96% of those who installed the IDE extension started receiving and accepting suggestions on the same day.</strong> On average, developers took just one minute from seeing their first suggestion to accepting one, too. This was further validated in user surveys, with <strong>43% finding GitHub Copilot &ldquo;extremely easy to use&rdquo; and 51% rating it as &ldquo;extremely useful.&rdquo;</strong></p>\n<aside class=\"p-4 p-md-6 post-aside--large\"><p>As part of the GitHub Copilot service, we provide the measurement capabilities for our customers to determine gains from Copilot themselves.

When measured in aggregate, the number of pull requests per developer can be used to measure a team&rsquo;s throughput or velocity. Ultimately, an increase in pull requests represents an increase in value delivered, and <strong>Accenture developers saw an 8.69% increase in pull requests.</strong> Because each pull request must pass through a code review, the pull request merge rate is an excellent measure of code quality as seen through the eyes of a maintainer or coworker. <strong>Accenture saw a 15% increase to the pull request merge rate,</strong> which means that as the volume of pull requests increased, so did the number of pull requests passing code review.</p>\n<p>But we don&rsquo;t want to just shift issues downstream and overburden the system with low-quality code. It&rsquo;s one thing for a teammate to assess quality and yet another for new code to successfully complete CI runs where test automation evaluates code quality against deterministic measures. At Accenture, we saw an <strong>84% increase in successful builds</strong> suggesting not only that more pull requests were passing through the system, but they were also of higher quality as assessed by both human reviewers and test automation.</p>\n<p>By enabling developers to maintain focus and stay in the flow, GitHub Copilot doesn&rsquo;t sacrifice quality for speed. And our findings provide evidence for exactly that.</p>\n<p>In our study, <strong>developers accepted around 30% of GitHub Copilot&rsquo;s suggestions</strong>. And <strong>90% of the developers</strong> reported that they committed code suggested by GitHub Copilot, while <strong>91% of the developers reported that their teams had merged pull requests containing code suggested by GitHub Copilot</strong>. Analysis also showed high usage rates with the accepted code&mdash;for example, <strong>developers retained 88% of GitHub Copilot-generated characters in their editor</strong>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-78029 width-fit\" src=\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image4.png?w=1024&#038;resize=1024%2C541\" alt=\"A chart showing how developers at Accenture gauged GitHub Copilot&rsquo;s impact on production code, also outlined in the preceding paragraph.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"541\" srcset=\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image4.png?w=1999 1999w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image4.png?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image4.png?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image4.png?w=1024&#038;resize=1024%2C541 1024w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image4.png?w=1536 1536w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image4.png?w=400 400w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image4.png?w=516 516w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>By experiencing improved success rates in builds, developers can reduce the likelihood of errors.</p>\n<h3 id=\"github-copilot-improved-the-overall-developer-experience\" id=\"github-copilot-improved-the-overall-developer-experience\" >GitHub Copilot improved the overall developer experience<a href=\"#github-copilot-improved-the-overall-developer-experience\" class=\"heading-link pl-2 text-italic text-bold\" aria-label=\"GitHub Copilot improved the overall developer experience\"></a></h3>\n<p>Our survey among Accenture developers unveiled compelling findings indicating a significant boost in overall developer satisfaction with GitHub Copilot. An impressive <strong>90% of developers expressed feeling more fulfilled with their jobs</strong> when utilizing GitHub Copilot, and a staggering <strong>95% of developers reported enjoying coding more when leveraging GitHub Copilot&rsquo;s capabilities</strong>.</p>\n<p>This enhancement in job satisfaction could allow developers to allocate their focus toward tasks most fulfilling to them, like solutions design or collaboration. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that developers&rsquo; heightened fulfillment correlated directly with their engagement with GitHub Copilot. When using GitHub Copilot less than two days per week, fulfillment only increased &ldquo;a little.&rdquo; But when using GitHub Copilot more than 2 days per week, fulfillment increases &ldquo;quite a bit.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>70% of developers also reported quite a bit less mental effort was expended on repetitive tasks, and 54% spent less time searching for information or examples when utilizing GitHub Copilot. This reduction in cognitive load could enable developers to allocate their cognitive resources more efficiently, reducing burnout. GitHub Copilot also allowed developers to maintain uninterrupted focus, with a majority indicating that they could maintain <a href=\"https://github.blog/2024-01-22-how-to-get-in-the-flow-while-coding-and-why-its-important/\">flow state</a> while using the tool, a hallmark of good DevEx.

            "content": "<p>Starting today, administrators using <code>Github.com</code> accounts can enable their repositories and/or organizations to run Dependabot updates jobs as a GitHub Actions workflow using both hosted and self-hosted runners. <strong>Running Dependabot does not count towards GitHub Actions minutes–meaning that using Dependabot continues to be free for everyone</strong>.</p>\n<p>Since its launch, Dependabot has used hosted compute to simplify the process of running update jobs, minimizing the amount of work developers need to do to stay on top of security vulnerabilities. However, this compute system wasn’t able to access some on-premises resources like private registries–a growing best practice outlined in frameworks like <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/opensource/osssscframeworkguide\">S2C2F</a>–and it wasn’t as flexible as it could be. Further, as GitHub Actions has become more ubiquitous over the years, users told us they wanted to see the logs for all their jobs in just one place.</p>\n<p>To tackle these challenges, GitHub is consolidating Dependabot’s compute platform to GitHub Actions, and jobs that generate pull requests can now be run as GitHub Actions workflows. This allows Dependabot to leverage GitHub Actions infrastructure, including connecting Dependabot to self-hosted runners. With this change, users can choose to run Dependabot on their private networks with self-hosted runners, allowing Dependabot to access on-premises private registries and update those packages. Developers will see performance improvements, like faster Dependabot runs and increased log visibility. APIs and webhooks for GitHub Actions can also detect failed runs and perform downstream processing should developers wish to configure this in their CI/CD pipelines.</p>\n<p>For more information on how to enable your repositories with Dependabot as a GitHub Actions workflow, please see our documentation for <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/about-dependabot-on-github-actions-runners#about-dependabot-on-github-actions-runners\">Dependabot on GitHub Actions runners</a>.

This migration will include faster runs, increased troubleshooting visibility, self-hosted runners, and other performance and feature benefits. For most users, the transition will be seamless; however, if your organization has <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-github-actions-in-your-enterprise\">disabled GitHub Actions by policy</a>, your administrators will receive instructions about how to update your configuration to ensure that the Dependabot service is not interrupted.</p>\n<p>Up next for Dependabot: in addition to <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/announcements\">gathering your feedback</a> on Dependabot on the GitHub Actions compute infrastructure, the team is working to support additional <code>dependabot.yml</code> configuration options for multiple directories and multiple ecosystems.

This development builds upon our initial offering of <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2023-06-21-github-hosted-larger-runners-for-actions-are-generally-available/\">more powerful GitHub-hosted runners</a> equipped with Static IPs, marking a strategic move to cater to the complex networking and security needs of enterprise customers.</p>\n<p>The value of utilizing hosted runners is two-fold. For individual developers, it maximizes their coding time by eliminating the overhead associated with infrastructure management. Simultaneously, for DevOps administrators, it significantly reduces the time and cost required to manage and maintain compute infrastructure for software life cycle automation, thereby streamlining operations and allowing teams to focus on innovation. The rollout of larger runners was not just an upgrade; it was the beginning of a comprehensive plan aimed at enterprise-grade readiness, providing robust virtual machines and features tailored for business needs. A great testament to this is <a href=\"https://github.blog/2023-09-26-how-github-uses-github-actions-and-actions-larger-runners-to-build-and-test-github-com/\">how we, at GitHub, have transformed our CI system</a> to meet the scaling demands of our engineering teams and enabled them to confidently and quickly ship software with GitHub Actions and GitHub-hosted runners.</p>\n<p>Today, we unveil the next chapter by generalizing Azure private networking, ensuring all runner tiers, starting from our 2-vCPU runners, now support auto-scaling, static IPs and private networking capabilities. Additionally, we&rsquo;re generalizing larger macOS runners and introducing a brand new GPU runner in public beta. These enhancements are a testament to our commitment to simplifying the adoption of GitHub Actions across all project sizes and complexities; and empowering you to standardize on GitHub seamlessly and securely as your automation and CI/CD platform.

This feature allows you to run your actions workflows on GitHub-hosted runners that are connected to your Azure virtual network, without compromising on security or performance.</p>\n<p>GitHub-hosted runners provide powerful compute in the cloud for running your CI/CD and automation workflows that are fully managed, eliminating the overhead of managing and maintaining your own infrastructure. However, we heard from enterprises having strict networking and security requirements that prevented them from using GitHub-hosted runners to their full potential, specifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Secure access to private resources within their on-prem or cloud based locations, such as databases, artifactory, storage accounts, or APIs.</li>\n<li>Enforce network security policies and outbound access rules on the runners to reduce data exfiltration risks.</li>\n<li>Isolate their build traffic from the public internet and route it through their existing private network connections (for example, VPN or ExpressRoute).</li>\n<li>Monitor network traffic for any malicious or unusual behavior as workflows run.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With Azure private networking, you can easily create GitHub-hosted runners that are provisioned within your Azure virtual network and subnet of choice. Thereafter, your actions workflows can securely access Azure services like storage accounts, databases, and on-premises data sources, such as an artifactory through existing, pre-configured connections like <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways\">VPN gateways</a> and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction\">ExpressRoutes</a>. Additionally, security is front and center with this update. Any existing or new networking policies, such as <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview\">Network Security Group (NSG)</a> or firewall rules, will automatically apply to GitHub-hosted runners giving platform administrators comprehensive control over network security, all managed within a single place.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-77216 width-fit\" src=\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/new-network-configuration.png?w=1024&#038;resize=1024%2C582\" alt='Screenshot of the page for creating a new network configuration.
