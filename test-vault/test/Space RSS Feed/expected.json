In interviews she gave prior to her launch in March, she said she was looking forward to going out on a few EVAs (extravehicular activities, or spacewalks), and three outings were indeed planned.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/spacewalk-history.html\"><strong>Spacewalks: How they work and major milestones</strong></a></p><p>But, as she also said at the time, \"things just have a way of changing when you get up there.\"</p><p>\"On our first attempt … my partner, Matt Dominick, had some suit issues that were too important to take care of before going out into the vacuum,\" Dyson said on Friday, referring to a \"<a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/nasa-astronauts-spacewalk-june-13-2024-postponed\">spacesuit discomfort issue</a>\" that occurred on June 13.</p><p>NASA replaced Dominick with Michael Barratt for the next try, citing that Barratt already had a suit sized to him. Dyson and Barratt were to go out and achieve the same tasks — bringing in an antenna and doing some microorganism swabbing (\"a Covid test for the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/16748-international-space-station.html\">International Space Station</a>,\" quipped Dyson), <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/international-space-station-spacewalk-coolant-leak-postpone\">but they never got beyond opening the hatch</a>.</p><p>\"On the second attempt, it was … the station&apos;s umbilical that provides cooling and data and oxygen that had a leak. It wasn&apos;t discovered until removing the umbilical once we were at vacuum in the crew-lock,\" Dyson told Space.com. \"All of the events that happened in that period of time were very character-building for me, but also I felt during those moments were some of the finest in terms of communication, and that is what I think human interactions are all about — is communication.\"</p>\n<figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:66.67%;\"><img id=\"wczbPdmuRYosDY6UqRWiXF\" name=\"53815738204_a21e045d58_o.jpg\" alt=\"closeup of a female astronaut wearing a spacesuit, focusing on her face through the dark but transparent faceplate\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wczbPdmuRYosDY6UqRWiXF.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"caption-text\">NASA astronaut Tracy Caldwell Dyson is pictured in her spacesuit prior to the start of a June 24, 2024 spacewalk that ended after just 31 minutes due a water leak from a suit umbilical. </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: NASA)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>\"Nothing was more important to me during that period of time than being able to communicate — not just with the ground, but with my crewmate Mike Barratt who was in the crew-lock with me, as well as the rest of our crew,\" she said.</p><p>Communications were key, Dyson explained, because she was the only person who could see what was happening. Barratt&apos;s and her helmet cameras were not yet turned on, and the exterior-mounted video cameras did not have a good angle into the crew-lock. </p><p>\"Basically, it was a firehose of water and slush coming out my umbilical and it covered my visor with ice, so I could not see what was going on.

In their infancy, those stellar bodies are referred to as \"<a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/james-webb-space-telescope-carina-nebula-image-protostars\">protostars</a>,\" and they are surrounded by a prenatal cocoon of gas and dust, from which they formed.</p><p>Over time, this cloud flattens as it swirls around the protostar, which feeds from it to gather enough mass to kick-start the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/what-is-nuclear-fusion\">fusion of hydrogen to helium</a> at its core. This process defines what is a <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/22437-main-sequence-star.html\">main sequence</a> or \"grown-up\" star.</p><p>However, in order for the protostar to feed and grow, the gas swirling around it must lose angular momentum. If it didn&apos;t, it would simply continue to spin around the protostar in perpetuity, suspended and never falling to its surface. </p><p>Yet, despite how ubiquitous this process must be in the cosmos, scientists have struggled to understand the mechanism behind the loss of inertia. One suggestion that has gained support recently is that winds driven by magnetism raging through the protoplanetary disk could funnel gas from its surface, carrying away angular momentum. </p>\n<figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1600px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"7fJa2go322cxRdJjWVbXPD\" name=\"Untitled design - 2024-04-02T142124.250.png\" alt=\"A glowing orange disk with a dark red blob at its center\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7fJa2go322cxRdJjWVbXPD.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"caption-text\">The protoplanetary disk around the infant star PDS 70, as seen by the JWST. </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: ALMA (ESO/NAOJ/NRAO)/Benisty et al.)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Team member Tracy Beck, a researcher at NASA’s Space Telescope Science Institute, pointed out that because other mechanisms are at work generating winds in protoplanetary disks, it was key for the team to distinguish between these processes.</p><p>For instance, a <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/37231-young-star-chaotic-magnetic-field.html\">protostar’s magnetic field </a>creates an \"X-wind\" that pushes out material at the inner edge of the protoplanetary disk.

Remarkably, there was a total on Jul. 11, 2010, just over 14 years ago, but before that, it was 1788. The next one is in 2324. After watching any solar eclipse, the most common question is, \"When&apos;s the next one?\" Not in this group. Everyone here knew that the next total is on Aug. 12, 2026.

Our planet has a certain carrying capacity, or what the Club of Rome — a think-tank of academics, business leaders and politicians — called the \"<a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.clubofrome.org/publication/the-limits-to-growth/#:~:text=Published%201972%20%E2%80%93%20The%20message%20of,long,%20even%20with%20advanced%20technology.\" target=\"_blank\"><u>limits to growth</u></a>\" in their famous 1973 report. They warned that Earth was beginning to reach its carrying capacity, and soon we would be generating too much energy, eating too much food, not producing enough fresh water, and pouring greenhouse emissions into the atmosphere that would render our global closed-loop system unsustainable. Indeed, as <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/what-is-climate-change-explained\"><u>climate change</u></a> grows <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/human-driven-global-warming-report\"><u>increasingly more damaging</u></a> year upon year, leading to more frequent droughts, famines, wildfires and extreme weather, some might say we have already reached that stage.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/satellite-data-climate-change-crisis\"><strong>How satellite data has proven climate change is a climate crisis</strong></a></p><p>This is where learning to live in space can help teach us how to live sustainably on Earth. It&apos;s not a new idea, but a recent paper by researchers at the German Aerospace Center in the journal <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://sustainableearthreviews.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42055-021-00042-9#:~:text=Similarly,%20reduction%20of%20using%20primary,to%20sustainable%20development%20on%20Earth.\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Sustainable Earth Reviews</u></a> succinctly summed up how technologies designed for living in closed-loop space habitats can be applied to Earth.    </p><p>They described how a space habitat must fulfill several functions in order to remain a closed-loop system, and how each of these can be re-applied to the larger scale of the Earth.</p><p>First, resources must be cultivated and fed into the system. In this case, resources means anything and everything that a habitat requires to function, from food to energy. This concept has to be managed carefully, however, because left unchecked it is open to exploitation. For example, if all the water-ice is mined from the lunar regolith too quickly, then there would be none left to supply a lunar base for very long.</p><p>Second is the recycling of those resources so they don&apos;t get used up too quickly. In a closed-loop habitat, unrecycled waste is costly and can diminish the habitat over time because it means there is progressively less of any given resource to go around. It can also pollute the environment of the habitat, again diminishing it.</p><p>Third is self-sufficiency. Barring the occasional resupply from Earth, a space habitat needs to be able to produce and repair everything that it needs.</p>\n<figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2048px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"yMCJPgvWkN5eC4UiRXTTRf\" name=\"51814201006_e93b98b15e_k Cropped.jpg\" alt=\"ISS with Earth below.\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yMCJPgvWkN5eC4UiRXTTRf.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1152\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"caption-text\"> The International Space Station isn't an entirely closed-loop habitat, but it is being used to pioneer technologies that could one day make other space habitats self-sufficient.  </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: NASA)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Finally, a closed-loop habitat must be resilient enough to support its crew and any other animal or plant life, indefinitely. If the system breaks down because it is being abused, the lifespan of the habitat becomes severely reduced.</p><p>We can see how each of these can be applied to Earth. Intensive farming, mining, fishing and so on shows how we are exploiting the cultivation of resources in our closed-loop Earth. Recycling can help us maintain our resources without fouling the environment with waste. If communities can become more self-sufficient, then carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced because resources are not having to be transported to communities from external regions.</p><p>Earth has shown resilience for life for almost four billion years, but our careless approach to the environment by overconsumption is testing that resilience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"space-on-earth-xa0-2\">Space on Earth </h2>\n<p>Interestingly, technologies developed for use in space can also help on Earth. </p><p>A classic example is solar panels. Invented back in 1954, during the era of coal-fired power stations, solar panels weren&apos;t exactly all the rage because there wasn&apos;t much use for photovoltaic cells on Earth at the time. Rather, solar panels first got their breakthrough in space, providing power for satellites as early as 1958 with the Vanguard 1 satellite. The amount of money that space-faring nations were able to pour into R&D for solar cells meant that, by the 1970s, those cells were capable enough to be used on Earth. Today, we find solar cells everywhere, the average panel producing 1.5 kilowatts of electricity each day; and, as of 2023 solar power generates a total of 5.5% of the world&apos;s electricity without the harmful emissions of coal-fired power stations or the toxic waste of nuclear fission reactors.</p><p>Another technology developed in space that can help support a more sustainable way of living on Earth are food-based. Crops are being grown by astronauts on the International Space Station. </p><p>The experiment, known as the Vegetable Production System, first produced lettuce in 2021, which was harvested by NASA astronaut Michael Hopkins. The experiment revolves around planting seeds in a \"seed pillow\" along with the controlled release of fertilizer and clay and the use of specially designed LED lights to promote photosynthesis, emitting more red and blue light that encourages plant growth. These lights are now being adapted for \"vertical farming\" on Earth, which is a sustainable way of growing crops that don&apos;t take up too much land in urban areas and recycle their water, just like on the space station. By growing food in vertical farms close to built-up communities, humans can cut down on transport costs and intensive farming, both of which produce high carbon dioxide emissions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-water-cycle-2\">The water cycle</h2>\n<p>Speaking of water, it is paramount that water is recycled on the space station, because its weight means that it is costly to bring up from Earth. All the water on the International Space Station is recycled through a water recovery system, as part of the station&apos;s Environmental Control and Life Support System, that can turn water vapor  humans breathe out into the air, sweat and even urinate into drinking water (which apparently, astronauts claim, tastes quite good!). The Urine Processor Assembly employs vacuum distillation to extract clean water from astronaut pee, leaving behind a yucky-sounding \"urine brine.\" A Brine Processor Assembly has even been developed because usable water is still present in this brine — in a closed-loop system, every resource has to be utilized to its fullest extent.</p><p>Although we don&apos;t need to drink water from urine on Earth, there are many locations around the globe where fresh, clean water is in short supply. NASA&apos;s water recovery technology has been licensed to companies to make portable filters that allow communities to obtain clean water from contaminated supplies.</p>\n<figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:4288px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:66.42%;\"><img id=\"JCrserF7ajVgQBCGL4B4EC\" name=\"Andre_Kuipers_water_droplet.jpg\" alt=\"A water droplet in microgravity with a person behind.\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JCrserF7ajVgQBCGL4B4EC.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"4288\" height=\"2848\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"caption-text\">European Andre Kuipers with a water droplet in the microgravity environment of the International Space Station. Water on the space station is a precious resource that has to be conserved and recycled.  </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: ESA/NASA)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"carbon-cleaning-2\">Carbon cleaning</h2>\n<p>Along with water vapor, astronauts breathe out carbon dioxide. </p><p>The astronauts on <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/17250-apollo-13-facts.html\"><u>Apollo 13</u></a> learned, first-hand, the dangers of carbon dioxide build-up when they had to hurriedly build a carbon-dioxide filter out of spare parts on their way home from the moon. On the International Space Station, carbon dioxide must be similarly scrubbed out of the air.</p><p>Previously, oxygen was produced on the ISS by a system that extracted it from 400 liters of water brought up from Earth each year. Therefore, it was not a closed-loop system. Now, the European Space Agency has developed the Advanced Closed Loop System (ACLS) that is able to recycle 50% of the carbon dioxide on the station into oxygen and no longer necessitates that large amounts of water be brought up from Earth. The ACLS&apos;s Carbon dioxide Reprocessing Assembly mixes hydrogen and carbon dioxide extracted from the air to produce water and methane. The methane is vented into space as waste, but an Oxygen Generation Assembly is able to split the water into oxygen and hydrogen, the latter of which goes back into the ACLS system to begin the cycle again.</p><p>However, prior to the ACLS, carbon dioxide was removed exclusively via a mineral called zeolite, which has pores small enough to trap carbon dioxide molecules in, then flush them into space. Now, Stefano Brandani and Giulio Santori of the University of Edinburgh are exploring ways of using the zeolite technology to reduce carbon dioxide in Earth&apos;s atmosphere. They envisage giant fans sucking in air filled with carbon dioxide towards stations made from beds of zeolite that remove the carbon dioxide from the air. The same technology could also be used nearer the source, removing carbon dioxide from waste gases produced by industry before they are released into the atmosphere. Although it cannot remove all the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and prevent global warming, carbon-capture technology could help mitigate climate change and help the world stay within the target of no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming.</p>\n<div  class=\"fancy-box\"><div class=\"fancy_box-title\">Related Stories:</div><div class=\"fancy_box_body\"><p class=\"fancy-box__body-text\">— <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/climate-change-earth-mapping-nasa-rivers\">Scientists are mapping Earth&apos;s rivers from space before climate change devastates our planet</a></p><p class=\"fancy-box__body-text\">— <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/earth-weather-getting-weirder-climate-scientist\">Why is Earth&apos;s weather getting weirder?</a></p><p class=\"fancy-box__body-text\">— <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/coral-reefs-moon-climate-change\">Should we seal DNA samples of Earth&apos;s endangered species in a moon crater?</a></p></div></div>\n<p>Given the criticism often leveled at space programs worldwide that they are expensive luxuries then money could be spent elsewhere on Earth instead, it is ironic that technology developed to help people live in space could help us live better on Earth. Of course, space travel is not environmentally friendly per se — a rocket can emit up to 300 tons of carbon dioxide per launch — but if applied correctly, the technology used in space can certainly redress the balance by helping us become a greener planet. Earth, after all, is our most incredible spaceship.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>This article is part of a special series by Space.com in honor of World Space Week 2024, which runs from Oct. 4 to Oct. 10.

            "content": " <p>Using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), astronomers have spotted the earliest powerful \"galaxy-size\" wind blowing from a feeding supermassive black hole-powered quasar. The powerful wind is pushing gas and dust from its galaxy at incredible speeds, killing star birth in its host galaxy. </p><p>This <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/17262-quasar-definition.html\">quasar</a>, designated J1007+2115, is so distant that it is seen as it was just 700 million years after <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/25126-big-bang-theory.html\">the Big Bang</a> — when <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/24054-how-old-is-the-universe.html\">the 13.8 billion-year-old universe</a> was just around 5% of its current age. Though this makes J1007+2115 just the third-earliest quasar ever seen, it is the earliest ever observed with a powerful, galaxy-size wind flowing from it.</p><p>The outflows from this quasar aren&apos;t just remarkable for their antiquity, though. The winds from J1007+2115 stretch out from the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/15421-black-holes-facts-formation-discovery-sdcmp.html\">black hole</a> at their source for a staggering 7,500 light-years, which is equivalent to around 3,750 solar systems lined up side-by-side! The material they shunt each year is equivalent to 300 suns at speeds equivalent to 6,000 times the speed of sound, researchers said.</p>\n<div class='jwplayer__widthsetter'><div class='jwplayer__wrapper'><div id='futr_botr_W4UdZVVR_bQHItauA_div' class='future__jwplayer'><div id='botr_W4UdZVVR_bQHItauA_div'></div></div></div></div>\n<p>\"It is the third-earliest and third-most-distant quasar powered by an accreting supermassive black hole known today,\" discovery team leader and University of Arizona researcher Weizhe Liu told Space.com. \"To our knowledge, this galaxy-scale <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/most-distant-quasar-discovery-giant-black-hole\">quasar-driven wind</a> is currently the earliest one known.\"</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/black-hole-quasar-neighbor-galaxies\">How black-hole-powered quasars killed off neighboring galaxies in the early universe</a></p><p>The winds from this feeding central supermassive black hole may even be powerful enough to \"kill\" the host galaxy they rip through at 6,000 times the speed of sound, by depriving it of the matter needed to birth new stars.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-supermassive-black-holes-get-wind-2\">How supermassive black holes get wind</h2>\n<p>All large <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/15680-galaxies.html\">galaxies</a> are believed to have at their hearts a supermassive black hole, sporting a mass between millions and billions of times that of <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/58-the-sun-formation-facts-and-characteristics.html\">the sun</a>. But not all of these black holes power quasars, the brightest sources of light in the cosmos. </p><p>That&apos;s because some supermassive black holes aren&apos;t surrounded by vast amounts of gas and dust that they can feed on. For instance, the supermassive black hole at the heart of our own galaxy, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/sagittarius-a\">Sagittarius A*</a> (Sgr A*), is quiet and dim.</p><p>Other supermassive black holes are surrounded by a wealth of material swirling around them in a flattened cloud called an accretion disk that gradually feeds them. The immense gravitational influence of the central black hole causes powerful friction in accretion disks, heating this material and causing it to glow brightly.</p><p>These regions, called <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/9692-black-holes-galaxy-collisions.html\">active galactic nuclei</a> (AGNs) are so bright they can outshine the combined light of every star in the galaxy around them. When seen at great distances, these regions are called \"quasars.\"</p><p>The powerful radiation emitted by accretion disks has another effect, too: It pushes away matter like gas and dust from around the AGN. These quasar winds can also push gas and dust away from the wider quasar-hosting galaxy.</p>\n<figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2000px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:100.00%;\"><img id=\"\" name=\"Windy-Quasar.jpg\" alt=\"An artist's depiction of the same system as seen in infrared light.\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yBqusLw3Ssjg3XrojFHNgn.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"2000\" height=\"2000\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"caption-text\">An artist's depiction, in infrared light, of a quasar-driven wind emanating from the core of a distant galaxy.  </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: International Gemini Observatory/NOIRLab/NSF/AURA/P.

As you might imagine, such powerful and far-reaching winds carry a vast amount of matter. Liu said that the quasar winds from J1007+2115 are carrying material with a mass equivalent to 300 suns each year.</p><p>The galaxy that houses J1007+2115 is rich in dense molecular gas and dust, the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/26482-cosmic-dust-survives-star-explosions.html\">building blocks of stars</a>, as seen by the JWST. The galaxy forms stars at a rate of around 80 to 250 solar masses every year. But the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/james-webb-space-telescope-see-the-past\">light from that galaxy has been traveling to us for 13.1 billion years</a>, meaning it is likely quite different now.
