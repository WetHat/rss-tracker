Even copying and pasting the lyrics of your favorite song can be considered a form of web scraping! However, the term ‚Äúweb scraping‚Äù usually refers to a process that involves automation. While some websites don‚Äôt like it when automatic scrapers gather their data, which can lead to <a href=\"https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/12/\">legal issues</a>, others don‚Äôt mind it.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre scraping a page respectfully for educational purposes, then you‚Äôre unlikely to have any problems. Still, it‚Äôs a good idea to do some research on your own to make sure you‚Äôre not violating any Terms of Service before you start a large-scale web scraping project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reasons-for-automated-web-scraping\">Reasons for Automated Web Scraping<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#reasons-for-automated-web-scraping\" title=\"Permanent link\"></a></h3>\n<p>Say that you like to surf‚Äîboth in the ocean and online‚Äîand you‚Äôre looking for employment. It‚Äôs clear that you‚Äôre not interested in just <em>any</em> job. With a surfer‚Äôs mindset, you‚Äôre waiting for the perfect opportunity to roll your way!</p>\n<p>You know about a job site that offers precisely the kinds of jobs you want. Unfortunately, a new position only pops up once in a blue moon, and the site doesn‚Äôt provide an email notification service. You consider checking up on it every day, but that doesn‚Äôt sound like the most fun and productive way to spend your time. You‚Äôd rather be outside surfing real-life waves!</p>\n<p>Thankfully, Python offers a way to apply your surfer‚Äôs mindset. Instead of having to check the job site every day, you can use Python to help automate the repetitive parts of your job search. With <strong>automated web scraping</strong>, you can write the code once, and it‚Äôll get the information that you need many times and from many pages.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> In contrast, when you try to get information manually, you might spend a lot of time clicking, scrolling, and searching, especially if you need large amounts of data from websites that are regularly updated with new content. Manual web scraping can take a lot of time and be highly repetitive and error-prone.</p>\n</div>\n<p>There‚Äôs so much information on the internet, with new information constantly being added. You‚Äôll probably be interested in some of that data, and much of it is out there for the taking. Whether you‚Äôre actually on the job hunt or just want to automatically download all the lyrics of your favorite artist, automated web scraping can help you accomplish your goals.</p>\n<h3 id=\"challenges-of-web-scraping\">Challenges of Web Scraping<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#challenges-of-web-scraping\" title=\"Permanent link\"></a></h3>\n<p>The internet has grown organically out of many sources. It combines many different technologies, styles, and personalities, and it continues to grow every day. In other words, the internet is a hot mess! Because of this, you‚Äôll run into some challenges when scraping the web:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Variety:</strong> Every website is different. While you‚Äôll encounter general structures that repeat themselves, each website is unique and will need personal treatment if you want to extract the relevant information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Durability:</strong> Websites constantly change. Say you‚Äôve built a shiny new web scraper that automatically cherry-picks what you want from your resource of interest. The first time you <a href=\"https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/\">run your script</a>, it works flawlessly. But when you run the same script a while later, you run into a discouraging and lengthy stack of <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-traceback/\">tracebacks</a>!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unstable scripts are a realistic scenario because many websites are in active development. If a site‚Äôs structure changes, then your scraper might not be able to navigate the sitemap correctly or find the relevant information. The good news is that changes to websites are often small and incremental, so you‚Äôll likely be able to update your scraper with minimal adjustments.</p>\n<p>Still, keep in mind that the internet is dynamic and keeps on changing. Therefore, the scrapers you build will probably require maintenance. You can set up <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-continuous-integration/\">continuous integration</a> to run scraping tests periodically to ensure that your main script doesn‚Äôt break without your knowledge.</p>\n<h3 id=\"an-alternative-to-web-scraping-apis\">An Alternative to Web Scraping: APIs<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#an-alternative-to-web-scraping-apis\" title=\"Permanent link\"></a></h3>\n<p>Some website providers offer <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-api/\">application programming interfaces (APIs)</a> that allow you to access their data in a predefined manner. With APIs, you can avoid parsing <a href=\"https://realpython.com/html-css-python/\">HTML</a>. Instead, you can access the data directly using formats like <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-json/\">JSON</a> and <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-xml-parser/\">XML</a>. HTML is primarily a way to visually present content to users.</p>\n<p>When you use an API, the data collection process is generally more stable than it is through web scraping. That‚Äôs because developers create APIs to be consumed by programs rather than by human eyes.</p>\n<p>The front-end presentation of a site might change often, but a change in the website‚Äôs design doesn‚Äôt affect its API structure. The structure of an API is usually more permanent, which means it‚Äôs a more reliable source of the site‚Äôs data.</p>\n<p>However, APIs <em>can</em> change as well. The challenges of both variety and durability apply to APIs just as they do to websites. Additionally, it‚Äôs much harder to inspect the structure of an API by yourself if the provided documentation lacks quality.</p>\n</div><h2><a href=\"https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/?utm_source=realpython&utm_medium=rss\">Read the full article at https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/ ¬ª</a></h2>\n        <hr />\n        <p><em>[ Improve Your Python With üêç Python Tricks üíå ‚Äì Get a short &amp; sweet Python Trick delivered to your inbox every couple of days. <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-tricks/?utm_source=realpython&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=footer\">&gt;&gt; Click here to learn more and see examples</a> ]</em></p>"

Before discussing threading in Python, it‚Äôs important to revisit two related terms that you may have heard about in this context:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Concurrency</strong>: The ability of a system to handle multiple tasks by allowing their execution to overlap in time but not necessarily happen simultaneously.</li>\n<li><strong>Parallelism</strong>: The simultaneous execution of multiple tasks that run at the same time to leverage multiple processing units, typically multiple CPU cores.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Python‚Äôs <a href=\"https://realpython.com/intro-to-python-threading/#what-is-a-thread\">threading</a> is a <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-concurrency/\">concurrency framework</a> that allows you to spin up multiple threads that run concurrently, each executing pieces of code. This improves the efficiency and responsiveness of your application. When running multiple threads, the Python interpreter switches between them, handing the control of execution over to each thread. </p>\n<p>By running the script below, you can observe the creation of four threads:</p>\n<div class=\"codeblock mb-3 w-100\" aria-label=\"Code block\" data-syntax-language=\"python\">\n  <div class=\"codeblock__header d-flex justify-content-between codeblock--blue\">\n    <span class=\"mr-2 noselect\" aria-label=\"Language\">Python</span>\n    <span class=\"mr-2\" aria-label=\"Filename\"><code style=\"color: inherit; background: inherit;\">threading_example.py</code></span>\n    <div class=\"noselect\">\n      \n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div style=\"position: relative;\">\n    <div class=\"highlight highlight--with-header\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">threading</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">time</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">concurrent.futures</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">ThreadPoolExecutor</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">threaded_function</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">number</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"nb\">range</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"nb\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sa\">f</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Printing from </span><span class=\"si\">{</span><span class=\"n\">threading</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">current_thread</span><span class=\"p\">()</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">name</span><span class=\"si\">}</span><span class=\"s2\">. </span><span class=\"si\">{</span><span class=\"n\">number</span><span class=\"si\">=}</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">time</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">sleep</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mf\">0.1</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">with</span> <span class=\"n\">ThreadPoolExecutor</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">max_workers</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"mi\">4</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">thread_name_prefix</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Worker\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"n\">executor</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">_</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"nb\">range</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">4</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">executor</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">submit</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">threaded_function</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n    \n    <button class=\"codeblock__copy btn btn-outline-secondary border m-1 px-1 d-hover-only\" title=\"Copy to clipboard\"><span class=\"icon baseline\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#@copy\"></use></svg></span></button>\n    <template class=\"codeblock__copied-template\">\n      <span class=\"small\"><span class=\"icon baseline mr-1 text-success\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#@check\"></use></svg></span>Copied!</span>\n    </template>\n    \n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>In this example, <code>threaded_function</code> prints the values zero to two that your <code>for</code> loop assigns to the loop variable <code>number</code>. Using a <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code>, four threads are created to execute the threaded function. <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code> is configured to run a maximum of four threads concurrently with <code>max_workers=4</code>, and each worker thread is named with a ‚ÄúWorker‚Äù prefix, as in <code>thread_name_prefix=\"Worker\"</code>. </p>\n<p>In <code>print()</code>, the <code>.name</code> attribute on <code>threading.current_thread()</code> is used to get the name of the current thread. This will help you identify which thread is executed each time. A call to <code>sleep()</code> is added inside the threaded function to increase the likelihood of a context switch.</p>\n<p>You‚Äôll learn what a context switch is in just a moment. First, run the script and take a look at the output:</p>\n<div class=\"codeblock mb-3 w-100\" aria-label=\"Code block\" data-syntax-language=\"console\" data-is-repl=\"true\">\n  <div class=\"codeblock__header d-flex justify-content-between codeblock--yellow\">\n    <span class=\"mr-2 noselect\" aria-label=\"Language\">Shell</span>\n    \n    <div class=\"noselect\">\n      \n        <span class=\"codeblock__output-toggle\" title=\"Toggle prompts and output\" role=\"button\"><span class=\"icon baseline js-codeblock-output-on codeblock__header--icon-lower\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#regular--rectangle-terminal\"></use></svg></span></span>\n      \n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div style=\"position: relative;\">\n    <div class=\"highlight highlight--with-header\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">$ </span>python<span class=\"w\"> </span>threading_example.py\n<span class=\"go\">Printing from Worker_0. number=0</span>\n<span class=\"go\">Printing from Worker_1. number=0</span>\n<span class=\"go\">Printing from Worker_2. number=0</span>\n<span class=\"go\">Printing from Worker_3. number=0</span>\n<span class=\"go\">Printing from Worker_0. number=1</span>\n<span class=\"go\">Printing from Worker_2. number=1</span>\n<span class=\"go\">Printing from Worker_1. number=1</span>\n<span class=\"go\">Printing from Worker_3. number=1</span>\n<span class=\"go\">Printing from Worker_0. number=2</span>\n<span class=\"go\">Printing from Worker_2. number=2</span>\n<span class=\"go\">Printing from Worker_1. number=2</span>\n<span class=\"go\">Printing from Worker_3. number=2</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n    \n    <button class=\"codeblock__copy btn btn-outline-secondary border m-1 px-1 d-hover-only\" title=\"Copy to clipboard\"><span class=\"icon baseline\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#@copy\"></use></svg></span></button>\n    <template class=\"codeblock__copied-template\">\n      <span class=\"small\"><span class=\"icon baseline mr-1 text-success\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#@check\"></use></svg></span>Copied!</span>\n    </template>\n    \n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Each line in the output represents a <code>print()</code> call from a worker thread, identified by <code>Worker_0</code>, <code>Worker_1</code>, <code>Worker_2</code>, and <code>Worker_3</code>. The number that follows the worker thread name shows the current iteration of the loop each thread is executing. Each thread takes turns executing the <code>threaded_function</code>, and the execution happens in a concurrent rather than sequential manner. </p>\n<p>For example, after <code>Worker_0</code> prints <code>number=0</code>, it‚Äôs not immediately followed by <code>Worker_0</code> printing <code>number=1</code>. Instead, you see outputs from <code>Worker_1</code>, <code>Worker_2</code>, and <code>Worker_3</code> printing <code>number=0</code> before <code>Worker_0</code> proceeds to <code>number=1</code>. You‚Äôll notice from these interleaved outputs that multiple threads are running at the same time, taking turns to execute their part of the code.</p>\n<p>This happens because the Python interpreter performs a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch\">context switch</a>. This means that Python pauses the execution state of the current thread and passes control to another thread. When the context switches, Python saves the current execution state so that it can resume later. By switching the control of execution at specific intervals, multiple threads can execute code concurrently.</p>\n<p>You can check the context switch interval of your Python interpreter by typing the following in the REPL:</p>\n<div class=\"codeblock mb-3 w-100\" aria-label=\"Code block\" data-syntax-language=\"pycon\" data-is-repl=\"true\">\n  <div class=\"codeblock__header d-flex justify-content-between codeblock--blue\">\n    <span class=\"mr-2 noselect\" aria-label=\"Language\">Python</span>\n    \n    <div class=\"noselect\">\n      \n        <span class=\"codeblock__output-toggle\" title=\"Toggle prompts and output\" role=\"button\"><span class=\"icon baseline js-codeblock-output-on codeblock__header--icon-lower\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#regular--rectangle-terminal\"></use></svg></span></span>\n      \n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div style=\"position: relative;\">\n    <div class=\"highlight highlight--with-header\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">sys</span>\n<span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"n\">sys</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">getswitchinterval</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"go\">0.005</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n    \n    <button class=\"codeblock__copy btn btn-outline-secondary border m-1 px-1 d-hover-only\" title=\"Copy to clipboard\"><span class=\"icon baseline\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#@copy\"></use></svg></span></button>\n    <template class=\"codeblock__copied-template\">\n      <span class=\"small\"><span class=\"icon baseline mr-1 text-success\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#@check\"></use></svg></span>Copied!</span>\n    </template>\n    \n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>The output of calling the <code>getswitchinterval()</code> is a number in seconds that represents the context switch interval of your Python interpreter. In this case, it‚Äôs 0.005 seconds or five milliseconds. You can think of the switch interval as how often the Python interpreter checks if it should switch to another thread. </p>\n<p>An interval of five milliseconds doesn‚Äôt mean that threads switch exactly every five milliseconds, but rather that the interpreter considers switching to another thread at these intervals.</p>\n<p>The switch interval is defined in the Python docs as follows:</p>\n</div><h2><a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-thread-lock/?utm_source=realpython&utm_medium=rss\">Read the full article at https://realpython.com/python-thread-lock/ ¬ª</a></h2>\n        <hr />\n        <p><em>[ Improve Your Python With üêç Python Tricks üíå ‚Äì Get a short &amp; sweet Python Trick delivered to your inbox every couple of days. <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-tricks/?utm_source=realpython&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=footer\">&gt;&gt; Click here to learn more and see examples</a> ]</em></p>"

With this knowledge, you'll be able to create managed attributes in your classes, perform lazy attribute evaluation, provide computed attributes, and more.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"managing-attributes-in-your-classes\">Managing Attributes in Your Classes<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#managing-attributes-in-your-classes\" title=\"Permanent link\"></a></h2>\n<p>When you define a <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-classes/\">class</a> in an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming\">object-oriented</a> programming language, you‚Äôll probably end up with some instance and class <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/#class-and-instance-attributes\">attributes</a>. In other words, you‚Äôll end up with variables that are accessible through the instance, class, or even both, depending on the language. Attributes represent and hold the internal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)\">state</a> of a given object, which you‚Äôll often need to access and mutate.</p>\n<p>Typically, you have at least two ways to access and mutate an attribute. Either you can access and mutate the attribute directly or you can use methods. Methods are <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-built-in-functions/\">functions</a> attached to a given class. They provide the behaviors and actions that an object can perform with its internal data and attributes.</p>\n<p>If you expose attributes to the user, then they become part of the class‚Äôs public <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-api/\">API</a>. This means that your users will access and mutate them directly in their code. The problem comes when you need to change the internal implementation of a given attribute.</p>\n<p>Say you‚Äôre working on a <code>Circle</code> class and add an attribute called <code>.radius</code>, making it public. You finish coding the class and ship it to your end users. They start using <code>Circle</code> in their code to create a lot of awesome projects and applications. Good job!</p>\n<p>Now suppose that you have an important user that comes to you with a new requirement. They don‚Äôt want <code>Circle</code> to store the radius any longer. Instead, they want a public <code>.diameter</code> attribute.</p>\n<p>At this point, removing <code>.radius</code> to start using <code>.diameter</code> could break the code of some of your other users. You need to manage this situation in a way other than removing <code>.radius</code>.</p>\n<p>Programming languages such as <a href=\"https://realpython.com/oop-in-python-vs-java/\">Java</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B\">C++</a> encourage you to never expose your attributes to avoid this kind of problem. Instead, you should provide <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-getter-setter/\">getter and setter</a> methods, also known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessor_method\">accessors</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutator_method\">mutators</a>, respectively. These methods offer a way to change the internal implementation of your attributes without changing your public API.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Getter and setter methods are often considered an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern\">anti-pattern</a> and a signal of poor object-oriented design. The main argument behind this proposition is that these methods break <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)\">encapsulation</a>. They allow you to access and mutate the components of your objects from the outside.</p>\n</div>\n<p>These programming languages need getter and setter methods because they don‚Äôt have a suitable way to change an attribute‚Äôs internal implementation when a given requirement changes. Changing the internal implementation would require an API modification, which can break your end users‚Äô code.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-getter-and-setter-approach-in-python\">The Getter and Setter Approach in Python<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#the-getter-and-setter-approach-in-python\" title=\"Permanent link\"></a></h3>\n<p>Technically, there‚Äôs nothing that stops you from using getter and setter <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/#instance-methods\">methods</a> in Python. Here‚Äôs a quick example that shows how this approach would look:</p>\n<div class=\"codeblock mb-3 w-100\" aria-label=\"Code block\" data-syntax-language=\"python\">\n  <div class=\"codeblock__header d-flex justify-content-between codeblock--blue\">\n    <span class=\"mr-2 noselect\" aria-label=\"Language\">Python</span>\n    <span class=\"mr-2\" aria-label=\"Filename\"><code style=\"color: inherit; background: inherit;\">point_v1.py</code></span>\n    <div class=\"noselect\">\n      \n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div style=\"position: relative;\">\n    <div class=\"highlight highlight--with-header\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">Point</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"fm\">__init__</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">_x</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span>\n        <span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">_y</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">get_x</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">_x</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">set_x</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">value</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">_x</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">value</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">get_y</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">_y</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">set_y</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">value</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">_y</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">value</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n    \n    <button class=\"codeblock__copy btn btn-outline-secondary border m-1 px-1 d-hover-only\" title=\"Copy to clipboard\"><span class=\"icon baseline\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#@copy\"></use></svg></span></button>\n    <template class=\"codeblock__copied-template\">\n      <span class=\"small\"><span class=\"icon baseline mr-1 text-success\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#@check\"></use></svg></span>Copied!</span>\n    </template>\n    \n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>In this example, you create a <code>Point</code> class with two <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-double-underscore/#creating-public-and-non-public-names-in-python\">non-public</a> attributes <code>._x</code> and <code>._y</code> to hold the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system\">Cartesian coordinates</a> of the point at hand.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Python doesn‚Äôt have the notion of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_modifiers\">access modifiers</a>, such as <code>private</code>, <code>protected</code>, and <code>public</code>, to restrict access to attributes and methods. In Python, the distinction is between <strong>public</strong> and <strong>non-public</strong> class members.</p>\n<p>If you want to signal that a given attribute or method is non-public, then you have to use the well-known Python <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#method-names-and-instance-variables\">convention</a> of prefixing the name with an <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-double-underscore/\">underscore</a> (<code>_</code>). That‚Äôs the reason behind the naming of the attributes <code>._x</code> and <code>._y</code>.</p>\n<p>Note that this is just a convention. It doesn‚Äôt stop you and other programmers from accessing the attributes using <strong>dot notation</strong>, as in <code>obj._attr</code>. However, it‚Äôs bad practice to violate this convention.</p>\n</div>\n<p>To access and mutate the value of either <code>._x</code> or <code>._y</code>, you can use the corresponding getter and setter methods. Go ahead and save the above definition of <code>Point</code> in a Python <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-modules-packages/\">module</a> and <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-import/\">import</a> the class into an <a href=\"https://realpython.com/interacting-with-python/\">interactive session</a>.

Note that although the name <strong>structural pattern matching</strong> is often shortened to just <strong>pattern matching</strong>, the qualifier <em>structural</em> is crucial to understanding the use cases for this feature. In this section, you‚Äôll get a high-level overview of structural pattern matching.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-pattern-matching\">What Is Pattern Matching?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#what-is-pattern-matching\" title=\"Permanent link\"></a></h3>\n<p>You can think of pattern matching as a form of <a href=\"https://realpython.com/syntactic-sugar-python/\">syntactic sugar</a> built on top of existing language constructs, including <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-conditional-statements/\">conditional statements</a> and <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-tuple/#packing-and-unpacking-tuples\">tuple unpacking</a>. While you can absolutely live without pattern matching, it gives you new superpowers, making this feature more convenient than the conventional syntax in some situations.</p>\n<p>Pattern matching often leads to more elegant, concise, and readable code written in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming\">declarative</a> style. To get a taste of it, take a quick look at the following example without trying to fully understand how it works just yet:</p>\n<div class=\"codeblock mb-3 w-100\" aria-label=\"Code block\" data-syntax-language=\"python\">\n  <div class=\"codeblock__header d-flex justify-content-between codeblock--blue\">\n    <span class=\"mr-2 noselect\" aria-label=\"Language\">Python</span>\n    \n    <div class=\"noselect\">\n      \n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div style=\"position: relative;\">\n    <div class=\"highlight highlight--with-header\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">json</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">event</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">match</span> <span class=\"n\">json</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">loads</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">event</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s2\">\"keyboard\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s2\">\"key\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s2\">\"code\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">code</span><span class=\"p\">}}}:</span>\n            <span class=\"nb\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sa\">f</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Key pressed: </span><span class=\"si\">{</span><span class=\"n\">code</span><span class=\"si\">}</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s2\">\"mouse\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s2\">\"cursor\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s2\">\"screen\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"p\">]}}}:</span>\n            <span class=\"nb\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sa\">f</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Mouse cursor: </span><span class=\"si\">{</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"si\">=}</span><span class=\"s2\">, </span><span class=\"si\">{</span><span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"si\">=}</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">case</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">_</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n            <span class=\"nb\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Unknown event type\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n    \n    <button class=\"codeblock__copy btn btn-outline-secondary border m-1 px-1 d-hover-only\" title=\"Copy to clipboard\"><span class=\"icon baseline\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#@copy\"></use></svg></span></button>\n    <template class=\"codeblock__copied-template\">\n      <span class=\"small\"><span class=\"icon baseline mr-1 text-success\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#@check\"></use></svg></span>Copied!</span>\n    </template>\n    \n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>The <code>match</code> statement takes a <strong>subject</strong>, which can be any valid Python expression, such as a string literal or a function call, and compares the resulting value to one or more <strong>patterns</strong> listed in the <code>case</code> clauses.

You‚Äôll learn more about the <code>match</code> statement and <code>case</code> clauses later in this tutorial.</p>\n<p>At first glance, the syntax of structural pattern matching in Python looks a bit like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_statement\"><code>switch</code> statement</a> found in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_C-family_programming_languages\">C-family</a> programming languages if you squint your eyes:</p>\n<div class=\"codeblock mb-3 w-100\" aria-label=\"Code block\" data-syntax-language=\"c\">\n  <div class=\"codeblock__header d-flex justify-content-between codeblock--purple\">\n    <span class=\"mr-2 noselect\" aria-label=\"Language\">C</span>\n    \n    <div class=\"noselect\">\n      \n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div style=\"position: relative;\">\n    <div class=\"highlight highlight--with-header\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kt\">void</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">log_event</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">enum</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Event</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">event</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">switch</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">event</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"k\">case</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"no\">KEYBOARD</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n<span class=\"w\">            </span><span class=\"n\">printf</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"Keyboard event</span><span class=\"se\">\\n</span><span class=\"s\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"w\">            </span><span class=\"k\">break</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"k\">case</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"no\">MOUSE</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n<span class=\"w\">            </span><span class=\"n\">printf</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"Mouse event</span><span class=\"se\">\\n</span><span class=\"s\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"w\">            </span><span class=\"k\">break</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"k\">default</span><span class=\"o\">:</span>\n<span class=\"w\">            </span><span class=\"n\">printf</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"Unknown event</span><span class=\"se\">\\n</span><span class=\"s\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n    \n    <button class=\"codeblock__copy btn btn-outline-secondary border m-1 px-1 d-hover-only\" title=\"Copy to clipboard\"><span class=\"icon baseline\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#@copy\"></use></svg></span></button>\n    <template class=\"codeblock__copied-template\">\n      <span class=\"small\"><span class=\"icon baseline mr-1 text-success\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#@check\"></use></svg></span>Copied!</span>\n    </template>\n    \n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>This resemblance is deceptive, though. The classic <code>switch</code> statement controls the execution flow based on the <strong>exact value</strong> stored in a variable. It effectively works as a chained sequence of mutually exclusive <code>if..elif...</code> equality comparisons, but with a more succinct and readable syntax.</p>\n<p>Although you can use pattern matching this way, you‚Äôd be missing out on its true power and flexibility. Structural pattern matching was designed to go beyond value comparisons. In particular, it combines <strong>conditional statements</strong> or branching based on a logical predicate with <strong>destructuring</strong> or object deconstruction, which is the inverse of object construction. You‚Äôll see examples of destructuring in the next section.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Because pattern matching does two things at once, the Python interpreter can take advantage of this to optimize the underlying bytecode with specialized opcodes, making the code run slightly faster.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The brief code snippet above merely scratches the surface of what you can achieve with pattern matching, but it already shows you its expressiveness, especially when you compare it with the traditional <code>if...elif...</code> statements and <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance\"><code>isinstance()</code></a> checks. Here‚Äôs one of the many ways you can implement the equivalent logic using standard Python:</p>\n<div class=\"codeblock mb-3 w-100\" aria-label=\"Code block\" data-syntax-language=\"python\">\n  <div

Syntactic sugar lets you express things in a clearer and more readable way.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It makes the language <em>sweeter</em> for human use: things can be expressed more clearly, more concisely, or in an alternative style that some may prefer. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar\">Source</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, syntactic sugar is something that you may not need in practice because you can get the same result using a different, and often more involved, construct.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This tutorial is slightly inspired by <a href=\"https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/92/\">Brett Cannon‚Äôs</a> series of posts about <a href=\"https://snarky.ca/tag/syntactic-sugar/\">unraveling syntactic sugar</a> in Python. In that series, Brett goes deep into each piece of syntactic sugar. You can check out the series if you‚Äôd like a detailed discussion of the syntax constructs covered in this tutorial and others.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Python has many pieces of syntactic sugar that you‚Äôll regularly use in your code. These syntax constructs make Python more readable, quicker to write, and user-friendly. Understanding these syntactic sugar pieces and their significance will help you better understand the inner workings of Python.</p>\n<p>In rare situations, you‚Äôll find that desugared versions of a given piece of syntactic sugar can better fulfill your needs. So, knowing about the alternative code to a given sugar can be a good skill to have.</p>\n<h2 id=\"operators-in-python\">Operators in Python<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#operators-in-python\" title=\"Permanent link\"></a></h2>\n<p>As with most programming languages, Python makes extensive use of operators. You‚Äôll find several categories of operators, including arithmetic, assignment, augmented assignment, comparison, <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-boolean/\">Boolean</a>, and membership operators. All these operators are part of Python‚Äôs syntactic sugar constructs because they let you write expressions in a quick and readable way.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> To dive deeper into Python operators, check out the <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-operators-expressions/\">Operators and Expressions in Python</a> tutorial.</p>\n</div>\n<p>For example, arithmetic operators allow you to create math expressions that are quick to write and read because they look pretty similar to what you learned in math class:</p>\n<div class=\"codeblock mb-3 w-100\" aria-label=\"Code block\" data-syntax-language=\"pycon\" data-is-repl=\"true\">\n  <div class=\"codeblock__header d-flex justify-content-between codeblock--blue\">\n    <span class=\"mr-2 noselect\" aria-label=\"Language\">Python</span>\n    \n    <div class=\"noselect\">\n      \n        <span class=\"codeblock__output-toggle\" title=\"Toggle prompts and output\" role=\"button\"><span class=\"icon baseline js-codeblock-output-on codeblock__header--icon-lower\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#regular--rectangle-terminal\"></use></svg></span></span>\n      \n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div style=\"position: relative;\">\n    <div class=\"highlight highlight--with-header\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"mi\">5</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"mi\">7</span>\n<span class=\"go\">12</span>\n\n<span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"mi\">10</span> <span class=\"o\">-</span> <span class=\"mi\">4</span>\n<span class=\"go\">6</span>\n\n<span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"mi\">2</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"mi\">4</span>\n<span class=\"go\">8</span>\n\n<span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"mi\">20</span> <span class=\"o\">/</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span>\n<span class=\"go\">10</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n    \n    <button class=\"codeblock__copy btn btn-outline-secondary border m-1 px-1 d-hover-only\" title=\"Copy to clipboard\"><span class=\"icon baseline\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#@copy\"></use></svg></span></button>\n    <template class=\"codeblock__copied-template\">\n      <span class=\"small\"><span class=\"icon baseline mr-1 text-success\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#@check\"></use></svg></span>Copied!</span>\n    </template>\n    \n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>In the first example, you use the plus operator (<code>+</code>) to add two numbers. In the second example, you use the subtraction operator (<code>-</code>) to subtract two numbers. The final two examples perform multiplication and division.</p>\n<p>Python supports its arithmetic operators through <strong>special methods</strong>. Here‚Äôs a quick summary:</p>\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n<table class=\"table table-hover\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"text-center\">Operator</th>\n<th>Operation</th>\n<th>Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"text-center\"><code>+</code></td>\n<td>Addition</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__add__\"><code>.__add__()</code></a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"text-center\"><code>-</code></td>\n<td>Subtraction</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__sub__\"><code>.__sub__()</code></a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"text-center\"><code>*</code></td>\n<td>Multiplication</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__mul__\"><code>.__mul__()</code></a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"text-center\"><code>/</code></td>\n<td>Division</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__truediv__\"><code>.__truediv__()</code></a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"text-center\"><code>//</code></td>\n<td>Integer division</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__floordiv__\"><code>.__floordiv__()</code></a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"text-center\"><code>**</code></td>\n<td>Exponentiation</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__pow__\"><code>.__pow__()</code></a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>What does it mean to say Python supports its operators through special methods?

            "content": "<div><p>October is always an important month for Python, as this is when a new major version is released. <strong>Python 3.13</strong> is the new version this year, and it brings several new features that lay the groundwork for other changes in the future. As one version of Python comes to life, another is put to rest. <strong>Python 3.8</strong> is already five years old, which means that this version won‚Äôt be supported any longer.</p>\n<p>There are also exciting developments happening in the wider Python community. In this newsletter, you can read about <strong>Polars‚Äô</strong> improved support for <strong>plotting</strong>, as well as how Django developers gathered for the annual <strong>DjangoCon US</strong> conference.</p>\n<p>Time to jump in and read about what‚Äôs happening in the world of Python!</p>\n<h2 id=\"python-313-release-slightly-delayed\">Python 3.13 Release Slightly Delayed<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#python-313-release-slightly-delayed\" title=\"Permanent link\"></a></h2>\n<p>The release of Python 3.13, the newest version of Python, was originally scheduled for October 1, 2024. However, a few days before that date, release manager Thomas Wouters decided to postpone the release until <strong>October 7, 2024</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I‚Äôm a little concerned with the impact of the incremental GC change in 3.13, which recently <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124567\">showed up</a>. It‚Äôs not clear that the incremental GC provides significant improvements (although the smaller pauses are probably desirable), it clearly has slightly more overhead in common cases, and we‚Äôre still discovering pathological cases.</p>\n<p>I don‚Äôt think we should release 3.13.0 with the incremental GC. (<a href=\"https://discuss.python.org/t/incremental-gc-and-pushing-back-the-3-13-0-release/65285\">Source</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The incremental <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-memory-management/#garbage-collection\">garbage collector</a> was a small improvement slated for Python 3.13. In many cases, the new garbage collection algorithm improves performance. Unfortunately, it was found to slow down Python significantly in some rare cases.</p>\n<p>As a result, the core developers decided to revert the implementation and use the traditional garbage collector in Python 3.13. At the same time, the new implementation is being scrutinized and currently the goal is to include incremental garbage collection in Python 3.14.</p>\n<p>Delaying a major Python release is never an easy choice. However, erring on the side of caution is a good approach, and it‚Äôs great to see that the Python 3.13 release is being handled responsibly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"python-313-highlights\">Python 3.13 Highlights<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#python-313-highlights\" title=\"Permanent link\"></a></h2>\n<p>As always, a new Python release brings many improvements and new features. You can explore these in-depth in <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python313-new-features/\">Python 3.13: Cool New Features for You to Try</a>. In particular, the new release includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A brand new interactive interpreter (REPL)</li>\n<li>Colored tracebacks and improved error messages</li>\n<li>A separate, free-threaded version of Python that runs without the global interpreter lock (GIL)</li>\n<li>An experimental just-in-time (JIT) compiler</li>\n<li>Several improvements to Python‚Äôs static type system</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For free threading and the JIT compiler, you need to compile Python with special build flags.

This interpreter is informally called the REPL because it‚Äôs based on a read-evaluate-print loop. The REPL <strong>reads</strong> your input, <strong>evaluates</strong> it, and <strong>prints</strong> the result before <strong>looping</strong> back and doing the same thing again.</p>\n<p>The Python REPL has been around for decades, and it supports an explorative workflow that makes Python a beginner-friendly language. Unfortunately, the interpreter has been missing several features you may have come to expect, including multiline editing and efficient pasting of code.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Experienced Python developers often install a third-party interactive interpreter instead of relying on the built-in REPL. You can learn more about the alternatives in these tutorials:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/ipython-interactive-python-shell/\">Unlock IPython‚Äôs Magical Toolbox for Your Coding Journey</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/bpython-alternative-python-repl/\">Discover bpython: A Python REPL With IDE-Like Features</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/ptpython-shell/\">Boost Your Coding Productivity With Ptpython</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also read more about alternative REPLs in the <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-repl/#using-an-alternative-repl\">guide to the standard REPL</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Begin by starting the REPL. You can do this by typing <code>python</code> in your <a href=\"https://realpython.com/terminal-commands/\">terminal</a>. Depending on your setup, you may have to write <code>py</code>, <code>python3</code>, or even <code>python3.13</code> instead. One way to recognize that you‚Äôre using the new interpreter shipping with Python 3.13 is that the prompt consisting of three chevrons (<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>) is subtly colored:</p>\n<figure class=\"js-lightbox\"><a href=\"https://files.realpython.com/media/colored_repl.93b1d9952ebb.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-fluid mx-auto d-block \" src=\"https://files.realpython.com/media/colored_repl.93b1d9952ebb.png\" width=\"1972\" height=\"797\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/width=493,format=auto/https://files.realpython.com/media/colored_repl.93b1d9952ebb.png 493w, /cdn-cgi/image/width=657,format=auto/https://files.realpython.com/media/colored_repl.93b1d9952ebb.png 657w, /cdn-cgi/image/width=986,format=auto/https://files.realpython.com/media/colored_repl.93b1d9952ebb.png 986w, /cdn-cgi/image/width=1972,format=auto/https://files.realpython.com/media/colored_repl.93b1d9952ebb.png 1972w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 690px, (min-width: 780px) calc(-5vw + 669px), (min-width: 580px) 510px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" alt=\"The new REPL in Python 3.13 shows a colored prompt\" data-asset=\"5984\"></a></figure>\n\n<p>One improvement is that you can now use REPL-specific commands without calling them with parentheses as if they are Python functions. Here are some of the commands and keyboard shortcuts you can use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>exit</code></strong> or <strong><code>quit</code></strong>: Exit the interpreter</li>\n<li><strong><code>clear</code></strong>: Clear the screen</li>\n<li><strong><code>help</code></strong> or <span class=\"keys\"><kbd class=\"key-f1\">F1</kbd></span>: Access the help system</li>\n<li><span class=\"keys\"><kbd class=\"key-f2\">F2</kbd></span>: Open the history browser</li>\n<li><span class=\"keys\"><kbd class=\"key-f3\">F3</kbd></span>: Enter paste mode</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can learn more about these options in <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python313-repl/\">Python 3.13 Preview: A Modern REPL</a>.</p>\n<p>Recalling code you‚Äôve written earlier has been cumbersome in the REPL before Python 3.13, especially if you‚Äôre working with a block of code spanning several lines. Traditionally, you‚Äôve had to bring back each line one by one by repeatedly pressing <span class=\"keys\"><kbd class=\"key-arrow-up\">Up</kbd></span>. Now in 3.13, you can bring back the whole block of code with a single <span class=\"keys\"><kbd class=\"key-arrow-up\">Up</kbd></span> keystroke.</p>\n<p>To try this for yourself, enter the following code in your REPL:</p>\n<div class=\"codeblock mb-3 w-100\" aria-label=\"Code block\" data-syntax-language=\"pycon\" data-is-repl=\"true\">\n  <div class=\"codeblock__header d-flex justify-content-between codeblock--blue\">\n    <span class=\"mr-2 noselect\" aria-label=\"Language\">Python</span>\n    \n    <div class=\"noselect\">\n      \n        <span class=\"codeblock__output-toggle\" title=\"Toggle prompts and output\" role=\"button\"><span class=\"icon baseline js-codeblock-output-on codeblock__header--icon-lower\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#regular--rectangle-terminal\"></use></svg></span></span>\n      \n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div style=\"position: relative;\">\n    <div class=\"highlight highlight--with-header\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"n\">numbers</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">range</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">13</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"p\">[</span>\n<span class=\"gp\">... </span>    <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">number</span> <span class=\"o\">-</span> <span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"o\">**</span><span class=\"mi\">3</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">number</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">numbers</span>\n<span class=\"gp\">... </span>    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">number</span> <span class=\"o\">%</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span>\n<span class=\"gp\">... </span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"go\">[0, 8, 64, 216, 512]</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n    \n    <button class=\"codeblock__copy btn btn-outline-secondary border m-1 px-1 d-hover-only\" title=\"Copy to clipboard\"><span class=\"icon baseline\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#@copy\"></use></svg></span></button>\n    <template class=\"codeblock__copied-template\">\n      <span class=\"small\"><span class=\"icon baseline mr-1 text-success\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#@check\"></use></svg></span>Copied!</span>\n    </template>\n    \n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>You‚Äôre creating a somewhat complex <a href=\"https://realpython.com/list-comprehension-python/\">list comprehension</a> that calculates an offset cube of a range of numbers, but only if the numbers are odd. The important part is that for readability, you split the list comprehension over several lines. Now try hitting that <span class=\"keys\"><kbd class=\"key-arrow-up\">Up</kbd></span> key! The interpreter recalls all four lines at once, and you can continue to use your arrow keys to move around inside of the expression.</p>\n<p>You can make changes to your code and run it again. To execute the updated code, you need to move your cursor to the end of the last line in the code block.

After October 2024, you should be able to install Python 3.13 through any of the <a href=\"https://realpython.com/installing-python/\">regular channels</a>.</p>\n<p>A REPL, or a <strong>Read-Eval-Print Loop</strong>, is a program that allows you to work with code interactively. The REPL <strong>reads</strong> your input, <strong>evaluates</strong> it, and <strong>prints</strong> the result before <strong>looping</strong> back and doing the same thing again.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> To learn about the built-in REPL in Python and how it works in general, check out <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-repl/\">The Python Standard REPL: Try Out Code and Ideas Quickly</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<p>In any version of Python, you can start this interactive shell by typing the name of your Python executable in your terminal. Typically, this will be <code>python</code>, but depending on your operating system and your setup, you may have to use something like <code>py</code> or <code>python3</code> instead.</p>\n<p>Once you start the REPL in Python 3.13, you‚Äôll see a small but noticeable difference. The familiar Python interactive shell prompt, consisting of three right angle brackets (<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>), is now colored differently from the rest of the text:</p>\n<figure class=\"js-lightbox\"><a href=\"https://files.realpython.com/media/colored_repl.93b1d9952ebb.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-fluid mx-auto d-block \" src=\"https://files.realpython.com/media/colored_repl.93b1d9952ebb.png\" width=\"1972\" height=\"797\" srcset=\"/cdn-cgi/image/width=493,format=auto/https://files.realpython.com/media/colored_repl.93b1d9952ebb.png 493w, /cdn-cgi/image/width=657,format=auto/https://files.realpython.com/media/colored_repl.93b1d9952ebb.png 657w, /cdn-cgi/image/width=986,format=auto/https://files.realpython.com/media/colored_repl.93b1d9952ebb.png 986w, /cdn-cgi/image/width=1972,format=auto/https://files.realpython.com/media/colored_repl.93b1d9952ebb.png 1972w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 690px, (min-width: 780px) calc(-5vw + 669px), (min-width: 580px) 510px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" alt=\"The new REPL in Python 3.13 shows a colored prompt\" data-asset=\"5984\"></a></figure>\n\n<p>The color difference indicates that the shell now supports color. In the new shell, color is mainly used to highlight output in tracebacks. If your terminal doesn‚Äôt display color, then the new REPL will automatically detect this and fall back to its plain, colorless display.</p>\n<p>If you prefer to keep your interpreter free of color even when it‚Äôs supported, you can <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3.13/using/cmdline.html#controlling-color\">disable this new feature</a>. One option is to set the new environment variable <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3.13/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHON_COLORS\"><code>PYTHON_COLORS</code></a> to <code>0</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"codeblock mb-3 w-100\" aria-label=\"Code block\" data-syntax-language=\"console\" data-is-repl=\"true\">\n  <div class=\"codeblock__header d-flex justify-content-between codeblock--yellow\">\n    <span class=\"mr-2 noselect\" aria-label=\"Language\">Shell</span>\n    \n    <div class=\"noselect\">\n      \n        <span class=\"codeblock__output-toggle\" title=\"Toggle prompts and output\" role=\"button\"><span class=\"icon baseline js-codeblock-output-on codeblock__header--icon-lower\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#regular--rectangle-terminal\"></use></svg></span></span>\n      \n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div style=\"position: relative;\">\n    <div class=\"highlight highlight--with-header\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"hll\"><span class=\"gp\">$ </span><span class=\"nv\">PYTHON_COLORS</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"m\">0</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>python\n</span><span class=\"go\">Python 3.13.0rc2 (main, Sep 13 2024, 17:09:27) [GCC 9.4.0] on linux</span>\n<span class=\"go\">Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.</span>\n<span class=\"go\">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n    \n    <button class=\"codeblock__copy btn btn-outline-secondary border m-1 px-1 d-hover-only\" title=\"Copy to clipboard\"><span class=\"icon baseline\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#@copy\"></use></svg></span></button>\n    <template class=\"codeblock__copied-template\">\n      <span class=\"small\"><span class=\"icon baseline mr-1 text-success\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#@check\"></use></svg></span>Copied!</span>\n    </template>\n    \n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Setting <code>PYTHON_COLORS=0</code> disables color in the REPL. If you set the environment variable to <code>1</code>, you‚Äôll get the colored prompt and output. However, since it‚Äôs the default, this is rarely necessary.</p>\n<p>Before going any further, you‚Äôll exit the REPL. As you may know, the old REPL, that you‚Äôve used on Python 3.12 and earlier, has been widely commented on for the following idiosyncrasy:</p>\n<div class=\"codeblock mb-3 w-100\" aria-label=\"Code block\" data-syntax-language=\"pycon\" data-is-repl=\"true\">\n  <div class=\"codeblock__header d-flex justify-content-between codeblock--blue\">\n    <span class=\"mr-2 noselect\" aria-label=\"Language\">Python</span>\n    \n    <div class=\"noselect\">\n      \n        <span class=\"codeblock__output-toggle\" title=\"Toggle prompts and output\" role=\"button\"><span class=\"icon baseline js-codeblock-output-on codeblock__header--icon-lower\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#regular--rectangle-terminal\"></use></svg></span></span>\n      \n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div style=\"position: relative;\">\n    <div class=\"highlight highlight--with-header\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"n\">exit</span>\n<span class=\"go\">Use exit() or Ctrl-D (i.e. EOF) to exit</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n    \n    <button class=\"codeblock__copy btn btn-outline-secondary border m-1 px-1 d-hover-only\" title=\"Copy to clipboard\"><span class=\"icon baseline\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#@copy\"></use></svg></span></button>\n    <template class=\"codeblock__copied-template\">\n      <span class=\"small\"><span class=\"icon baseline mr-1 text-success\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#@check\"></use></svg></span>Copied!</span>\n    </template>\n    \n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>The shell clearly understands your intention to end the session. Still, it makes you jump through hoops and add parentheses to your command. In Python 3.13, the REPL now understands special commands that you can write without any parentheses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>exit</code></strong> or <strong><code>quit</code></strong>: Exit the interpreter</li>\n<li><strong><code>help</code></strong> or <span class=\"keys\"><kbd class=\"key-f1\">F1</kbd></span>: Access the help system</li>\n<li><strong><code>clear</code></strong>: Clear the screen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Having these commands more easily available is a small thing, but it removes some friction when using the interactive interpreter. You can still use parentheses and type something like <code>exit()</code> if you prefer. These commands are not reserved though. That means that you could shadow them with variable assignments:</p>\n<div class=\"codeblock mb-3 w-100\" aria-label=\"Code block\" data-syntax-language=\"pycon\" data-is-repl=\"true\">\n  <div class=\"codeblock__header d-flex justify-content-between codeblock--blue\">\n    <span class=\"mr-2 noselect\" aria-label=\"Language\">Python</span>\n    \n    <div class=\"noselect\">\n      \n        <span class=\"codeblock__output-toggle\" title=\"Toggle prompts and output\" role=\"button\"><span class=\"icon baseline js-codeblock-output-on codeblock__header--icon-lower\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#regular--rectangle-terminal\"></use></svg></span></span>\n      \n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div style=\"position: relative;\">\n    <div class=\"highlight highlight--with-header\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"n\">exit</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kc\">True</span>\n<span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"n\">exit</span>\n<span class=\"go\">True</span>\n<span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"n\">exit</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"gt\">Traceback (most recent call last):</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"c\">...</span>\n<span class=\"gr\">TypeError</span>: <span class=\"n\">'bool' object is not callable</span>\n\n<span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"k\">del</span> <span class=\"n\">exit</span>\n<span class=\"gp\">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class=\"n\">exit</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n    \n    <button class=\"codeblock__copy btn btn-outline-secondary border m-1 px-1 d-hover-only\" title=\"Copy to clipboard\"><span class=\"icon baseline\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#@copy\"></use></svg></span></button>\n    <template class=\"codeblock__copied-template\">\n      <span class=\"small\"><span class=\"icon baseline mr-1 text-success\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"/static/icons.6e7b751c31b4.svg#@check\"></use></svg></span>Copied!</span>\n    </template>\n    \n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Here you create a variable named <code>exit</code>, effectively disabling the <code>exit</code> command. To end your REPL session, you can either delete the <code>exit</code> variable or use one of the alternative ways to exit the interpreter.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Even with the new improvements, the built-in REPL is not as powerful as some of the third-party alternatives. If you‚Äôre already using any of these, there‚Äôs no immediate reason to revert back to the standard interactive interpreter.</p>\n<p>The main advantage of the new REPL is that it‚Äôs installed together with Python. In other words, it‚Äôll always be available for you. This is great if you find yourself in a situation where you can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to install a third-party library.</p>\n<p>You can learn more about the alternative interactive interpreters in the following tutorials:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/ipython-interactive-python-shell/\">Unlock IPython‚Äôs Magical Toolbox for Your Coding Journey</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/bpython-alternative-python-repl/\">Discover bpython: A Python REPL With IDE-Like Features</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/ptpython-shell/\">Boost Your Coding Productivity With Ptpython</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also read more about alternative REPLs in the <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-repl/#using-an-alternative-repl\">guide to the standard REPL</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div><h2><a href=\"https://realpython.com/python313-repl/?utm_source=realpython&utm_medium=rss\">Read the full article at https://realpython.com/python313-repl/ ¬ª</a></h2>\n        <hr />\n        <p><em>[ Improve Your Python With üêç Python Tricks üíå ‚Äì Get a short &amp; sweet Python Trick delivered to your inbox every couple of days. <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-tricks/?utm_source=realpython&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=footer\">&gt;&gt; Click here to learn more and see examples</a> ]</em></p>"

There are two similar <strong>special methods</strong> that describe the object using a string representation. These methods are <code>.__repr__()</code> and <code>.__str__()</code>.
