2023 was quite the year for me and PowerShell, so I thought I would put together a brief summary of the year as I saw it. Plus provide you with some fun and interesting statics from the PowerShell Weekly newsletter.

This year was also a huge year for me. My book [Practical Automation with PowerShell](https://www.manning.com/books/practical-automation-with-powershell?ar=false&lpse=B) was released in April. This book aims to help you take your PowerShell skills to the next level and create full enterprise-ready automations. It was a real labor of lover to share my experiences in automation with the world. And I hope everyone who has read it has found it useful.

Iâ€™m looking forward to 2024 where I plan on making some major updates to some of my community module, publish more blog content, and in general continue my journey with PowerShell and technology in general. But I know most of you arenâ€™t here to read about me, so here is my recap of some of the highlights from this year.

## PowerShell Platform

â€¢ [PowerShell 7.4](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershell-7-4-general-availability/) was made generally available in November and is now built on .NET 8.  
â€¢ The new package manager, [PSResourceGet](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSResourceGet) was released and is now included in PowerShell 7.4.  
â€¢ [Microsoft Graph](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/get-started?view=graph-powershell-1.0) modules have now officially replaced the Azure AD modules.  
â€¢ There were also new releases for [PSReadLine](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/psreadline-2-3-4-ga-release/) and [Crescendo](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/announcing-powershell-crescendo-1-1-0/).

## Community

â€¢ [The PowerShell Podcast](https://powershellpodcast.podbean.com/) is still going strong with weekly releases and are almost up to 100 episodes.  
â€¢ [The Pacific PowerShell User Group](https://www.meetup.com/pacific-powershell-user-group/) was started, and many local user groups are still going strong. Most notably the [New York PowerShell Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/nycpowershellmeetup/) and [Research Triangle PowerShell User Group](https://rtpsug.com/). (If you know of other PowerShell user groups please let me know and Iâ€™ll add them here.)  
â€¢ This year was also my time presenting at the PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit. It was great getting to meet so many member of the community in person. Be sure to check out the [PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit 2023 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYESMmlAeDc&list=PLE7tQUdRKcyYKuZmmRf9gFzvSw2uDon5u&index=55) on YouTube for my presentation and all of the others. And donâ€™t forget to purchase your tickets to the [2024 summit](https://powershell.org/2023/05/powershell-devops-global-summit-2024/).

## PowerShell Weekly by the Numbers

For those who arenâ€™t aware [PowerShell Weekly](https://psweekly.dowst.dev/) is a weekly collection of PowerShell news, blogs, scripts, and other related media from world the web, that I found useful and wanted to share. With this being the end of the year, I thought I would share some interesting insights and numbers from 2023. Start with the number:
