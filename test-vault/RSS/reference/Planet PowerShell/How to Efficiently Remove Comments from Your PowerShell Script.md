As part of my daily development, I create lots of code that I subsequently **comment** on and leave to ensure I understand what I tried, what worked, and what didn't. This is my usual method of solving a problem. Sure, I could commit it to git and then look it up, and I do that, but that doesn't change my behavior where I happen to have lots of ‚Äújunk‚Äù inside of my functions that stay commented out. While this works for me, and I've accepted this as part of my process, I don't believe this should be part of the production code on **PowerShellGallery** or when the code is deployed.

## Function to remove comments from PowerShell file

My goal was to have a **PowerShell** function that removes any comment inside my code except help comments. Thankfully, with help from **Chris Dent**, I created a method that eliminates comments from any given file and makes it production ready. While it's part of my module builder [PSPublishModule](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSPublishModule), I'm attaching it if you want to try it on your own.

function Remove-Comments {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Remove comments from PowerShell file

    .DESCRIPTION
    Remove comments from PowerShell file and optionally remove empty lines
    By default comments in param block are not removed
    By default comments before param block are not removed

    .PARAMETER SourceFilePath
    File path to the source file

    .PARAMETER Content
    Content of the file

    .PARAMETER DestinationFilePath
    File path to the destination file. If not provided, the content will be returned

    .PARAMETER RemoveEmptyLines
    Remove empty lines if more than one empty line is found

    .PARAMETER RemoveAllEmptyLines
    Remove all empty lines from the content

    .PARAMETER RemoveCommentsInParamBlock
    Remove comments in param block. By default comments in param block are not removed

    .PARAMETER RemoveCommentsBeforeParamBlock
    Remove comments before param block. By default comments before param block are not removed

    .EXAMPLE
    Remove-Comments -SourceFilePath 'C:\Support\GitHub\PSPublishModule\Examples\TestScript.ps1' -DestinationFilePath 'C:\Support\GitHub\PSPublishModule\Examples\TestScript1.ps1' -RemoveAllEmptyLines -RemoveCommentsInParamBlock -RemoveCommentsBeforeParamBlock

This function has a couple of parameters:

- **SourceFilePath** ‚Äì provide a path to a file you want to clean up
- **Content** ‚Äì alternatively to file way, you can also provide a code (for example `Get-Content -Raw $FilePath)`
- **DestinationFilePath** ‚Äì path to file where to save the cleaned-up file. If not provided, the content will be returned directly as a string.
- **RemoveEmptyLines** ‚Äì as part of the cleanup, it tries to remove empty lines, but only if there's more than one. This is useful if you have help with the function
- **RemoveAllEmptyLines** ‚Äì removes all empty lines from a file
- **RemoveCommentsInParamBlock** ‚Äì by default, during cleanup, any comments inside the **param** block are not removed, as those are often related to help. But if you want, you can also remove those with this switch.
- **RemoveCommentsBeforeParamBlock** ‚Äì I don't remove anything between the function and param block by default. This ensures that the help I create for the function stays where it is. But if you want to remove it, this is how you can fix it.
- **DoNotRemoveSignatureBlock** ‚Äì by default, we remove any signature from a file, but if you want to prevent that from happening, you can use this switch. It won't give you much because the signature will not work after you remove anything from the file anyways ‚Äì but it's there.

## How does comment removal work?

Let's take a look how this works. This is my file that I usually have in my modules:

[![](https://evotec.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/img_64e22dd028992.png)](https://evotec.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/img_64e22dd028992.png)

After applying comment cleanup function

Remove-Comments -FilePath "C:\Support\GitHub\PSSharedGoods\Public\Objects\Format-TransposeTable.ps1" -DestinationFilePath "C:\Support\GitHub\PSSharedGoods\Public\Objects\Format-TransposeTableFixed.ps1" -RemoveEmptyLines

As you can notice, all the ‚Äújunk‚Äù comments were removed, including inline comments. Comments for help were not removed, as per my requirements.
