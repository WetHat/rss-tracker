> [!abstract] Report on Non-Compliant Intune devices by Harm Veenstra - 2024-04-26T12:06:34.000Z

The report should give insight into what device has what issue with which setting; the person asking the question was already working on a Microsoft Graph script but couldn't find a suitable way. In this blog post, I will show how to create this report. There are other scripts out there, but I always like a challenge (And Microsoft Graph can be quite a challenge sometimes ;â‹¯

I received a question on the Microsoft Tech Community forum regarding creating a report about non-compliant Intune devices.

In this blog post, I will show how to create this report. There are other scripts out there, but I always like a challenge (And Microsoft Graph can be quite a challenge sometimes ;) )
