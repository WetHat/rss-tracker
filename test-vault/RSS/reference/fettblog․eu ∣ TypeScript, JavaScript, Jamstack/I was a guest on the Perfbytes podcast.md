The [Perfbytes](http://perfbytes.com) crew was live at this yearâ€™s Perform conference, interviewing crew, attendees and speakers. I had the chance to have a few minutes with them talking about the [Visually Complete](https://www.dynatrace.com/capabilities/digital-experience-monitoring/visually-complete/) metric and what it means for Real User Monitoring. Being a podcaster since 2009, it was funny for me doing an interview live from the other side of the microphone. But an experience I fully enjoyed, also mostly due to Markâ€™s excellent interviewing skills. I should do more live podcasts! If you like, give it a listen at [Spreaker](https://www.spreaker.com/user/pureperformance/dynatrace-perform-2017-wednesday-highlig). Itâ€™s a long show, my part starts roughly at 37 minutes. And keep in mind that I was super jetlagged. Thanks Mark and Brian for having me!
