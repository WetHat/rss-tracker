> [!abstract] My most favourite books in 2017 - 2017-12-28T00:00:00.000Z
> I started taking reading seriously again in 2017. I had highs where I read about 10 books a month (phew), and also lows where I havenâ€™t touched a page for a couple of months. Now with having both a toddler and a Kindle*, I gladly spend night again guarding the crib while reading both fiction and non-fiction. And oh, did I read a lot of non-fiction this year. There were some amazing books, and I want to share with you the ones that I found the most compelling.
