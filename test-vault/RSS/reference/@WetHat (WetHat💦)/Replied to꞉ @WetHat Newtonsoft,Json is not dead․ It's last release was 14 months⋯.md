[@irongut](https://mastodon.scot/@irongut) I did ask some fellow hackers why they would consider [https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json) dead.

Arguments for 'dead':  
➡️ ~700 open issues  
➡️~70 open pull requests (oldest being 1 year old)

Arguments against 'dead':  
➡️Reasonably stable and popular (~10k start)  
➡️A few commits per year (1 this year; 4 last year)

I'v updated the post and removed 'and dead', because I'd use this library anytime.
