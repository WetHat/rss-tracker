> [!abstract] Error TS2307: Cannot find module events - 2020-06-04T00:00:00.000Z
> If you're extending the `EventEmitter` class from Node.js and encounter the error TS2307 or TS2339, it means you're missing the Node.js type definitions. To fix this, install the typings by running `yarn add @types/node@12 --dev --tilde`. This solution has been tested with TypeScript 3.9.3 and Node.js 12.18.0 LTS.
