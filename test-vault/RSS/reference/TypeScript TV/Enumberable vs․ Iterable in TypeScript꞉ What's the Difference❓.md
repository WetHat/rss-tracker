> [!abstract] Enumberable vs. Iterable in TypeScript: What's the Difference? - 2024-01-10T15:37:39.000Z
> In TypeScript, "enumerable" and "iterable" are terms used to describe different aspects of data collections. Enumerable refers to an object's properties that can be counted or iterated over using a `for...in` loop. Iterable, on the other hand, refers to an object that can be traversed through its elements one by one using a `for...of` loop.
