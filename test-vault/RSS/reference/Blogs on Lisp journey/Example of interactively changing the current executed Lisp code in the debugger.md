The awesome example we will read comes from a comment by user lispm inside a discussion on this reddit thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/65ct5j/a_pythonist_finds_a_new_home_at_clojure_land/.

He wrote about his first impressions with Common Lisp here, where he raises usual concerns that I agree with but IMO that stay supercifial (“not readable” because of stuff like (format t "~{~{~a:~10t~a~%~}~%~}" *db*), “huge operators set”, “macros look promising”…).
