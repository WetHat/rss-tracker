> [!abstract] Why Deftask Chose Common Lisp - 2019-01-11T11:21:30.000Z
> We heard about Deftask, a task management app for teams, a few days ago, in an article about the internals of the Chronicity library. Deftask uses Common Lisp for its backend and its command-line app. This reasonates with the fact that Turtl doesnâ€™t use CL anymore. So I asked Deftaskâ€™s author: why did you go with CL ? More than anything else, I think its down to fun and productivity. I feel that I am at my most productive when I writing CL in Emacs+SLIME.
