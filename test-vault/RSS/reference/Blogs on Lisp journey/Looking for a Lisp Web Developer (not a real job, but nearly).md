> [!abstract] Looking for a Lisp Web Developer (not a real job, but nearly) - 2020-06-05T19:38:01.000Z
> Dear lispers, I decided that I can not develop three projects in parallel fast enough, so Iâ€™m seeking for a fellow programmer to join the effort. Disclaimer: this is not a real position, but there is a little budget I recently presented my online catalogue for bookshops. You will work on something very similar, but bigger. I need help to re-write the existing free software for bookshops in Common Lisp. The existing one is in Python.
