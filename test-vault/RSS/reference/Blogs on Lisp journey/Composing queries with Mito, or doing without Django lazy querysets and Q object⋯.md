> [!abstract] Composing queries with Mito, or doing without Django lazy querysets and Q objects - 2020-09-24T16:15:44.000Z
> When I didn’t know Lisp at all, I skimmed at CLSQL’s and Mito’s documentation and I didn’t find a mention of “lazy”, “querysets” (a Django term!) nor a mention of any means to compose queries. I had no idea how I would replace querysets, F and Q objects and the many functions for DB queries that were being added into newer Django versions. I concluded that the Lisp ecosystem was lagging behind.
