> Turtl is a very well done, secure collaborative notebook web app. https://turtlapp.com Its api backend is built in Common Lisp: https://github.com/turtl/api/ It is based on many async libraries the developer wrote for Turtl, like the Wookie async HTTP server. “is” ? No, was :/ Even though this repository is still maintained (latest commit: 2nd of december 2018), it is deprecated and the new server is written in NodeJS.
