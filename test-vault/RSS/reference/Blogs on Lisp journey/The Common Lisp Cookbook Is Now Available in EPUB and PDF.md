> [!abstract] The Common Lisp Cookbook Is Now Available in EPUB and PDF - 2021-01-19T10:32:25.000Z
> I am glad to announce that the Common Lisp Cookbook is now available in ePub and PDF. It is available for free, and you can pay what you want[1] to say a loud “thank you” and to further support its development. Thanks! This EPUB represents the work on the span of three years where I have been constantly reading, experimenting, asking, discovering tips, tools, libraries and best-practices, built-in or not, all of which should have been easily accessible but were not.
