> In CLOS, a slot can have a :type option, but it doesnâ€™t inforce type checking. It is good practice to use it, for documentation and for compiler optimizations and warnings sometimes (with CCL and SBCL when safety is high), but one shouldnâ€™t rely on it. To comply this need, we can simply create our own constructor functions. However, the sanity-clause library can do it since a couple of days. The validation error messages are pretty good.
