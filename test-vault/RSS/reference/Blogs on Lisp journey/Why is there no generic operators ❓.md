TLDR; because the object system came afterwards (and it was not the intention to make CL entirely object oriented). As a CL enthousiast coming from Python, I feel the pain not to have generic or polymorphic operators but having to learn about many specialized operators instead. Why is it so and are there solutions ? I asked on SO. In CL, there are many operators to check for equality that depend on the data type: =, string-equal, char=, then equal, eql and whatnot, so on for other data types, and the same for comparison operators.
