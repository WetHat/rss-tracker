> [!abstract] Celebrating 1001 learners on my Common Lisp course 🥳 - 2024-02-14T16:05:44.000Z
> I just got 1001 learners on my Common Lisp course on Udemy. Thanks everybody for your support, here or elsewhere! Starting with CL was honestly not easy. The first thing I did was writing the “data structures” page on the Cookbook, bewildered that it didn’t exist yet. A few years and a few projects later, this course allows me to share more, learn more, have fun, and have some rewards to keep the motivation up.
