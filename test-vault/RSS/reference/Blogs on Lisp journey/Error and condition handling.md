> Common Lisp has mechanisms for error and condition handling as found in other languages, and can do more. What is a condition ? Just like in languages that support exception handling (Java, C++, Python, etc.), a condition represents, for the most part, an “exceptional” situation. However, even more so that those languages, a condition in Common Lisp can represent a general situation where some branching in program logic needs to take place, not necessarily due to some error condition.
