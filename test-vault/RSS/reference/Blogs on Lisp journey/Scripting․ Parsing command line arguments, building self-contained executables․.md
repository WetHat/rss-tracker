> [!abstract] Scripting. Parsing command line arguments, building self-contained executables. - 2018-01-02T06:51:49.000Z
> Using a program from a REPL is fine and well, but if we want to distribute our program easily, weâ€™ll want to build an executable. Lisp implementations differ in their processes, but they all create self-contained executables, for the architecture they are built on. The final user doesnâ€™t need to install a Lisp implementation, he can run the software right away. Start-up times are near to zero, specially with SBCL and CCL.
