> See here: https://ko-fi.com/s/01fee22a32 Let me try something: I propose you here to buy the ePub, even though it is meant to be available for free. I contributed quite a lot to the Cookbook and I found since the beginning that having an EPUB and/or a PDF version would be very useful. Some years later, nobody did it, and I finally wrote a script to bundle all the pages together and generate an ePub, and then a PDF.
