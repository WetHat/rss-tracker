> [!abstract] Lisp Interview: more questions to CLPM author. Common Lisp at university for temporal reasoning and risk-bounded planning - 2020-11-15T07:22:59.000Z
> Some days ago on reddit/r/lisp, we got to (re)discover CLPM, the Common Lisp Package Manager. Its author, Eric Timmons aka daewok, was kind enough to give more context, and to answer some more questions of mine, about his use of Common Lisp in his university group. Below Iâ€™ll give an overview of CLPM, stress on how it differs from Quicklisp, and then paste the interview. /Note/: itâ€™s the same content as on reddit, but saved from oblivion!
