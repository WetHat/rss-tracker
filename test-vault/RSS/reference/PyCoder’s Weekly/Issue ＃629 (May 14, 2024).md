### [Flattening a List of Lists in Python](https://pycoders.com/link/12668/feed)

In this video course, you’ll learn how to flatten a list of lists in Python. You’ll use different tools and techniques to accomplish this task. First, you’ll use a loop along with the `.extend()` method of `list`. Then you’ll explore other tools, including `reduce()`, `sum()`, `itertools.chain()`, and more.

## Articles & Tutorials

### [A 100x Speedup With Unsafe Python](https://pycoders.com/link/12664/feed)

This is a deep, in the weeds analysis of how different packages can store the same kinds of data in a different order, and how row-based vs column-based storage order can affect NumPy’s speed to process the data. The not often examined “strides” value of a NumPy array specifies how things are stored and this article shows an interesting approach to getting around this value for speed-up.
