Python's built-in `next` function will consume the next item from a given iterator.

## Getting the next line from a file

You can use Python's `next` function to get the next line from a file:

`>>> with open("poems/harlem.txt", mode="rt")                                 as file:                                 ...  first_line = next(file)                                 ...                                 >>>                                 first_line                                 'What happens to a dream                                 deferred?\n'`
                                

The `next` function doesn't just work on [file objects](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/terms/#file-object) though. For example, it also works on `csv.reader` objects:

`>>> import csv                                 >>>                                 with open("penguins_small.csv", mode="rt",                                 newline="")                                 as penguins_file:                                 ...  reader = csv.reader(penguins_file)                                 ...  headers = next(reader)                                 ...                                 >>>                                 headers                                 ['species', 'island', 'bill_length_mm',                                 'bill_depth_mm', 'flipper_length_mm', 'body_mass_g',                                 'sex']`
                                

We just used `next` to pop off the header row just before we start [reading a CSV file](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/csv-reading/).

Besides file objects and `csv.reader` objects, what else does the `next` function work with?

## You can't use `next` on most iterables

If you pass a list â€¦
