Python's `collections.Counter` class is extremely handy, especially when paired with generator expressions.

## What is a `Counter`?

Python's [`collections.Counter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter) objects are similar to [dictionaries](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/using-dictionaries-in-python/) but they have a few extra features that can simplify item tallying.

`>>> from collections import Counter                                 >>>                                 colors = ["purple", "pink", "green", "yellow", "yellow", "purple", "purple", "black"]                                 >>>                                 color_counts                                 = Counter(colors)                                 >>>                                 color_counts                                 Counter({'purple': 3, 'yellow': 2, 'pink': 1,                                 'green': 1, 'black': 1})                                 >>>                                 color_counts['purple']                                 3`
