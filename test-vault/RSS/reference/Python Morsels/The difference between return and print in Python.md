Both `return` and `print` "output" something, but one shows output to an end user and the other doesn't.

## Both `print` and `return` _output_ something

Here's a [function](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/making-a-function/) called `nth_fibonacci` that calculates the nth [Fibonacci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence) and prints out the result:

`from math import sqrt                                  root5 = sqrt(5)                                 phi = (1                                 + root5)/2                                 # The golden ratio                                  def nth_fibonacci(n):                                 print(round(phi**n                                 / root5))`
                                

If we give it the number `20`, we'll see the 20th Fibonacci number:

`>>> nth_fibonacci(20)                                 6765`
                                

Here's a function that does nearly the same thing, except it uses `return` instead of [`print`](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/built-in-functions-in-python/#print):

`from math import sqrt                                  root5 = sqrt(5)                                 phi = (1                                 + root5)/2                                 # The golden ratio                                  def nth_fibonacci(n):                                 print(round(phi**n                                 / root5))                                 def nth_fibonacci2(n):                                 return round(phi**n                                 / root5)`
                                

When we call this second function, it seems like it does _exactly_ the same thing:

`>>> nth_fibonacci2(20)                                 6765                                 >>>                                 nth_fibonacci(20)                                 6765`
                                

What's going on here?
