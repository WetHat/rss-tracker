Recursion is when a function calls itself. Loops are usually preferable to recursion, but recursion is excellent for traversing tree-like structures.

## Recursive functions call themselves

Here's a [Python script](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/module-vs-script/) that counts up to a given number:

`from argparse import ArgumentParser                                  def count_to(number):                                 for n in                                 range(1,                                 number+1):                                 print(n)                                 def parse_args():                                 parser = ArgumentParser()                                 parser.add_argument("stop", type=int)                                 return parser.parse_args()                                  def main():                                 args = parse_args()                                 count_to(args.stop)                                 if __name__ == "__main__":                                 main()`
                                

Note that the [`main` function](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/making-main-function-python/) in that program calls the `parse_args` function as well as the `count_to` function.

Functions can [call _other_ functions](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/calling-a-function/) in Python. But functions can _also_ **call themselves**!

Here's a [function](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/making-a-function/) that calls itself:

`def factorial(n):                                 if n < 0:                                 raise ValueError("Negative numbers                                 not accepted")                                 if n ==                                 0:                                 return 1                                 return n *                                 factorial(n-1)`
                                

A function that calls itself is called a **recursive function**.

It might seem like a bad idea for a function to call itself and it often _is_ a bad idea... but not always.
