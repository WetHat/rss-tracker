## How far Python Morsels has come

My initial idea was simple â€” sending one real-world Python exercise every week via email. I had been teaching Python to teams and I wanted to see if I could bring learning techniques that I _know_ work to a much larger audience.

Fast forward to today, and Python Morsels has grown into a sophisticated web app with a treasure trove of hands-on learning materials and a level-based recommendation system. It's been quite a journey, and I'm immensely proud of what we've built.

The heart of Python Morsels has always been you: the Python learners and enthusiasts who've joined me on this journey. Your feedback and support have been the driving force behind this platform's evolution. Your success stories are my biggest source of motivation and I'm grateful to be a part of your learning journey.

The time I spent working on Python Morsels problems translates into **saved time programming for work**. And it's not a grind - **it's actually fun**. I've learned **advanced Python concepts** that I would have never had the opportunity to use in my day to day work.
