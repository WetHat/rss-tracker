## Outline an approach and walk away üí≠

Start by **outlining your approach** in **a [docstring](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/docstrings/) or a comment**. Be detailed, but use rough descriptions and **pseudocode**. You'll likely find yourself rereading the problem statement multiple times as you outline your approach.

For a challenging problem where you're likely to get stuck, **time-box your outlining time**. For example, set a timer for 15 minutes and then start outlining. When the timer goes off, **walk away**.

Walking away will let your brain **work on the problem in the background**. This will decrease the stress of getting stuck on a problem _and_ **allow your brain to be more creative** because you're now unencumbered by the need to solve the problem quickly.

Ideally, after outlining the problem you might take a shower, make yourself a meal, or go for a walk. If you can, try to perform an activity that doesn't require intent focus, **so your brain can wander**.

When you walk away from an exercise before it's complete, you're likely to keep pondering it. You might realize your approach has a flaw _or_ you might think of a completely different approach. The next time you sit down to solve your programming exercise, you'll likely find that you're **a bit more eager to jump in** than you would have if you'd kept coding right after outlining.
