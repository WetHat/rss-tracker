It may be marketed as a beginner's telescope, but Celestron doesn't cut any corners. It comes with a fully adjustable steel tripod, finderscope, 20mm and 10mm eyepieces, and has enough power to survey major bodies in our solar system. It also features an equatorial mount, instead of the simpler alt-azimuth mount, meaning it's easier to track night sky objects ‚Äî but it does take a little practice.

So if you've ever looked up at the heavens and wanted to see more, this is the deal for you and a brilliant way to get started with stargazing.

The Celestron AstroMaster 114EQ is a great place to start if you're totally new to stargazing. This package comes with everything you'll need; the telescope, a stand, a red dot finderscope and software to help guide you through the heavens.

It's also light enough you can transport it easily, handy if light pollution is an issue in your area. The fully-coated glass optics will ensure you get a clear view of the night sky.

While you won't be able to pick out every stellar object, you can zoom in on Saturn's rings, the moon's craters and more. You might not pick out any previously undiscovered comets, but you'll get to experience the wonder of stargazing.

And if you're already a pro, it's worth considering this if you want to get someone else into stargazing, since it's so easy to set up and use. You can even purchase a phone mount to help you take a permanent record of your observations.
