On [Episode 131 of This Week In Space](https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-space/episodes/131), Rod Pyle and Tariq Malik tackle a question that rivals the meaning of life itself: which is better, Star Trek or Star Wars?  
  
Of course, they are very different, and that's really the core of it--one is a sweeping fantasy adventure incorporating the "Hero's Journey," while the other is a science fantasy wrapped around a morality play. In the end, we love them both. But there is a bit of cultural (and perhaps generation) divide here, and someone has to put Tariq in his place. Join us for this civilization-shattering conversation!
