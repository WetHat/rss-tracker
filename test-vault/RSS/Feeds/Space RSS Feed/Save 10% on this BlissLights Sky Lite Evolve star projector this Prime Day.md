The BlissLights Sky Lite Evolve star projector is a brilliant but compact device, which can project stars and nebulas onto the ceiling of any small or mid-sized room, transforming them in an instant. It's utterly breathtaking and perfect for meditation, relaxation and more.

There's no fiddly little remote to lose since you can control every aspect of the device through your smartphone, tweaking this stellar display to your heart's content. You can even switch up the projector's color shifts but don't worry about it being jarring, its transitions are impressively seamless, as we noted in our [BlissLights Sky Lite Evolve review](https://www.space.com/blisslights-sky-lite-evolve-galaxy-star-projector-review).

It's also whisper quiet so if you're planning on using it to lull a child to sleep, you can tiptoe out of the room and let the BlissLights Sky Lite Evolve do its thing. It turns even the most mundane of rooms into a truly magical place.
