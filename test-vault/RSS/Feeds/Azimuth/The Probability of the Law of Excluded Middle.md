The [Law of Excluded Middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle) says that for any statement P, ‚ÄúP or not P‚Äù is true.

Is this law true? In classical logic it is. But in [intuitionistic logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_logic) it‚Äôs not.

So, in intuitionistic logic we can ask what‚Äôs the _probability_ that a randomly chosen statement obeys the Law of Excluded Middle. And the answer is ‚Äúat most 2/3‚Äîor else your logic is classical‚Äù.

This is a very nice new result by Benjamin Bumpus and Zoltan Kocsis:

‚Ä¢ Benjamin Bumpus, [Degree of classicality](https://bmbumpus.com/2024/02/27/degree-of-classicality/), _Merlin‚Äôs Notebook_, 27 February 2024.

Of course they had to make this more precise before proving it. Just as classical logic is described by [Boolean algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra), intuitionistic logic is described by something a bit more general: [Heyting algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heyting_algebra). They proved that in a finite Heyting algebra, if more than 2/3 of the statements obey the Law of Excluded Middle, then it must be a Boolean algebra!

Interestingly, nothing like this is true for ‚Äúnot not P implies P‚Äù. They showed this can hold for an arbitrarily high fraction of statements in a Heyting algebra that is still not Boolean.

Here‚Äôs a piece of the free Heyting algebra on one generator, which some call the Rieger‚ÄìNishimura lattice:

_Taking the principle of excluded middle from the mathematician would be the same, say, as proscribing the telescope to the astronomer or to the boxer the use of his fists._ ‚Äî David Hilbert

I disagree with this statement, but boy, Hilbert sure could write!
