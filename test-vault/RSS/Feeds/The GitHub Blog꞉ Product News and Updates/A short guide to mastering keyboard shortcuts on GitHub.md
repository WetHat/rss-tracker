Did you know that just about every page on GitHub has a keyboard shortcut? In this blog post, we’ll uncover the world of [GitHub keyboard shortcuts](https://docs.github.com/get-started/using-github/keyboard-shortcuts) and how they can help you navigate and perform actions swiftly. ⌨️

After reading this post, you’ll be able to:

💡 **Master the shortcuts.** You might be asking, how can I access said shortcuts? Simply by typing “?” on any Github page!* These shortcuts will empower you to perform various actions across the site without relying on your mouse.

🔧 **Customize your experience.** You can tailor your shortcut experience by enabling or disabling character key shortcuts according to your preferences, all within your accessibility settings. For more information, see “[Managing accessibility settings](https://docs.github.com/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-user-account-settings/managing-accessibility-settings).”

🎩 **Make magic.** With the [GitHub Command Palette](https://docs.github.com/get-started/using-github/github-command-palette), you can effortlessly navigate, search, and execute commands on GitHub—all without the need to memorize multiple keyboard combinations. To open the command palette, type in this combination:

- **Windows and Linux:** “Ctrl+K” or “Ctrl+Alt+K”
- **Mac:** “Command+K” or “Command+Option+K”

_Please note: not all shortcuts are available on every page. When you open the shortcut window (?), it will provide you with the available keyboard shortcuts._
