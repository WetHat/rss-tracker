Every Tuesday and Thursday, quite consistently, for two decades. But last year, without planning it, I got tired and stopped. Not sure why. It didn't correspond with any life events. Nothing interesting or notable happened. I just stopped.

I did find joy on [TikTok](https://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.tiktok.com/@shanselman) and amassed a small group of like-minded followers there. I enjoy my [YouTube](https://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.youtube.com/shanselman) as well, and my [weekly podcast](https://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselminutes.com/episodes) is going strong with nearly 900 (!) episodes of interviews with cool people. I've also recently [started posting on Mastodon](https://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://hachyderm.io/@shanselman) (a fediverse (federated universe)) Twitter alternative that uses the [ActivityPub web standard](https://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://activitypub.rocks/). I see that [Mark Downie has been looking at ActivityPub as well for DasBlog](https://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://github.com/poppastring/dasblog-core/issues/647) (the blog engine that powers this blog) so I need to spend sometime with Mark soon.

Being consistent is a hard thing, and I think I did a good job. I gave many talks over many years about [Personal Productivity](https://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/scott-hanselmans-complete-list-of-productivity-tips) but I always mentioned doing what "feeds your spirit." For a minute here the blog took a backseat, and that's OK. I filled that (spare) time with family time, personal projects, writing more code, 3d printing, games, taekwondo, and a ton of other things.

Going forward I will continue to write and share across a number of platforms, but it will continue to [start here](https://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/your-blog-is-the-engine-of-community) as [it's super important to Own Your Words](https://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/your-words-are-wasted). Keep taking snapshots and backups of your keystrokes as you never know when your chosen platform might change or go away entirely.

I'm still here. I hope you are too! I will see you soon.
