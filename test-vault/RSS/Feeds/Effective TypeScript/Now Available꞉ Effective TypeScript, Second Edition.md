![](https://effectivetypescript.com/images/cover-2e.jpg)I'm happy to [announce](https://twitter.com/danvdk/status/1788579805643915424) that the second edition of [_Effective TypeScript_](https://amzn.to/3UjPrsK) is now available! I've spent a good chunk of the past year working on this update, and I'm incredibly happy with how it's turned out.

You can buy a copy at all the usual places:

- [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3UjPrsK)
- [Amazon eBook](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-TypeScript-Dan-Vanderkam-ebook/dp/B0D2SGRTGR/) (Kindle)
- [DRM-free eBook](https://www.ebooks.com/en-us/book/211331398/effective-typescript/dan-vanderkam/) (ebooks.com)
- [Read online](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-typescript/9781098155056/) (O'Reilly)

If you'd like to read it online, you can get a free month of access to the O'Reilly online platform using promo code [ETYPESCRIPT24](https://learning.oreilly.com/get-learning/?code=ETYPESCRIPT24) (valid until the end of 2024).

The book has been thoroughly revised and expanded to reflect how TypeScript is used in 2024. You can find full [release notes](https://github.com/danvk/effective-typescript/releases/tag/2.0.0) on the book's GitHub page, but here are the highlights:

- Two new chapters: one on Generics and Type-Level Programming and one on TypeScript Recipes
- 24 new items (one item from the first edition was dropped)
- Coverage of new TypeScript features like template literal types and recursive type aliases.

TypeScript has changed and grown since 2019 and so has _Effective TypeScript_: it's 50% thicker!
