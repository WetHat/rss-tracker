As a Python developer who wants to harness the power of object-oriented programming, you‚Äôll love to learn how to customize your classes using **special methods**, also known as **magic methods** or **dunder methods**. A special method is a method whose name starts and ends with a double underscore. These methods have special meanings in Python.

Python automatically calls magic methods as a response to certain operations, such as instantiation, sequence indexing, attribute managing, and much more. Magic methods support core object-oriented features in Python, so learning about them is fundamental for you as a Python programmer.

**In this video course, you‚Äôll:**

- Learn what Python‚Äôs **special** or **magic methods** are
- Understand the **magic** behind magic methods in Python
- **Customize** different **behaviors** of your custom classes with special methods
