> [!abstract] Latest string manipulation functions in the STR library - 2023-12-22T15:52:51.000Z
> ![[RSS/assets/RSSdefaultImage.svg|float:right|100x100]] We just released cl-str v0.21. It’s been a while since the last release, and many enhancements make it more useful than ever. Let’s review the changes, the newest first. But first, I want to you thank everyone who contributed, by sending pull requests or feedback. Special thanks to @kilianmh who suddenly appeared one day, helped with new features as well as grunt work, and who is now a co-maintainer.
