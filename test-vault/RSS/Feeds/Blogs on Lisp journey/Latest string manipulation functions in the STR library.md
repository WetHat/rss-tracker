> [!abstract] Latest string manipulation functions in the STR library - 2023-12-22T15:52:51.000Z
> <span class="rss-image">![[RSS/assets/RSSdefaultImage.svg|200x200]]</span> We just released cl-str v0.21. It&rsquo;s been a while since the last release, and many enhancements make it more useful than ever. Let&rsquo;s review the changes, the newest first.
> But first, I want to you thank everyone who contributed, by sending pull requests or feedback. Special thanks to @kilianmh who suddenly appeared one day, helped with new features as well as grunt work, and who is now a co-maintainer.
