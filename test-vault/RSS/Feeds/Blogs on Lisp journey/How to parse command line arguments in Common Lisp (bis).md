> [!abstract] How to parse command line arguments in Common Lisp (bis) (by unknown)
> ![[RSS/assets/RSSdefaultImage.svg|float:right|100]] In 2018, I wrote a blog post and the Cookbook page on how to build Common Lisp binaries, and how to parse command-line arguments with the unix-opts library. But since then, new libraries were created an they are pretty good! They are simpler to use, and have much more features. I had a good experience with Clingon: its usage is clear, its documentation is very good, it is very flexible (it has hooks and generic functions waiting to have an :around method) and @dnaeon is not at his first great CL project.
