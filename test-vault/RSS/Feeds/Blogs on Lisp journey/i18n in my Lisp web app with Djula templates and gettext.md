> [!abstract] i18n in my Lisp web app with Djula templates and gettext (by unknown)
> ![[RSS/assets/RSSdefaultImage.svg|float:right|100]] I finally added translations to my Lisp web app \o/ I wanted to do it with gettext and Djula templates. There seemed to be some support for this, but it turned out‚Ä¶ not straightforward. After two failed attempts, I decided to offer a little 90 USD bounty for the task (I announced it on the project‚Äôs issues and on Discord, watch them out for future bounties ;) ). @fstamour took the challenge and is the person I‚Äôll be eternally grateful for :D He kindly set up everything, answered my questions and traced down annoying bugs.
