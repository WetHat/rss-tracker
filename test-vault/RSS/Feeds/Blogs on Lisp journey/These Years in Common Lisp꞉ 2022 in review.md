> [!abstract] These Years in Common Lisp: 2022 in review (by unknown)
> ![[RSS/assets/RSSdefaultImage.svg|float:right|100x100]] And 2022 is over. The Common Lisp language and environment are solid and stable, yet evolve. Implementations, go-to libraries, best practices, communities evolve. We don’t need a “State of the Ecosystem” every two weeks but still, what happened and what did you miss in 2022? This is my pick of the most exciting, fascinating, interesting or just cool projects, tools, libraries and articles that popped-up during that time (with a few exceptions that appeared in late 2021).
