> [!abstract] Oh no, I started a Magit-like plugin for the Lem editor (by unknown)
> ![[RSS/assets/RSSdefaultImage.svg|float:right|100x100]] Lem is an awesome project. It‚Äôs an editor buit in Common Lisp, ready to use out of the box for Common Lisp, that supports more languages and modes (Python, Rust, Elixir, Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, Haskell, Java, Nim, Dart, OCaml, Scala, Swift, shell, asm, but also markdown, ascii, JSON, HTML and CSS, SQL‚Ä¶) thanks to, in part, its built-in LSP support. I took the challenge to add an interactive interface for Git, √† la Magit, because you know, despite all its features (good vim mode, project-aware commands, grep, file tree view and directory mode, multiple cursors, tabs‚Ä¶), there‚Äôs so much an editor should do to be useful all day long.
