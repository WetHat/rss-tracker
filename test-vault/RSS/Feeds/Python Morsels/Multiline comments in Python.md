Python does not have multiline comments. But you can use alternatives like docstrings, editor shortcuts, and conventional commenting methods, depending on your requirements.

## Does Python have multi-line comments?

For single-line comments, Python uses the octothorpe character (`#`), also known as pound, number sign, crunch, and of course, the hashtag character:

```
# This is a comment

                                this = "is not a
                                comment"
```
