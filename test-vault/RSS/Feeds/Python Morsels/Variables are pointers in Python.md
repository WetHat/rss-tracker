Python's variables are not buckets that contain objects; they're pointers. Assignment statements don't copy: they point a variable to a value (and multiple variables can "point" to the same value).

## Changing two lists at once...?

Here we have a variable `a` that points to a [list](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/what-are-lists/):

```undefined
>>> a =
                                [2,
                                1, 3,
                                4]
                                
```

Let's make a new variable `b` and assign it to `a`:

```undefined
>>> a =
                                [2,
                                1, 3,
                                4]
                                >>>
                                b = a
                                
```

If we append a new item to `b`, what will its length be?

```undefined
>>> b.append(7)
                                >>>
                                len(b)
                                
```

Initially, the `b` list had four items, so now it should have five items. And it does:

```undefined
>>> len(b)
                                5
                                
```

How many items do you think `a` has? What's your guess?

```undefined
>>> len(a)
                                
```

Is it five, the same as `b`? Or is it still four, as it was before?

The `a` list also has five items:

```undefined
>>> len(a)
                                5
                                
```

What's going on here?

Well, the variables `a` and `b`, both point to the same list.

If we look up the unique ID for the object that each of these variables points to, we'll see that **they both point to the same object**:

```undefined
>>> id(a)
                                140534104117312
                                >>>
                                id(b)
                                140534104117312
                                
```

This is possible because variables in Python are **_not_ buckets, but pointers**.

## Variables are _separate_ from objects

Let's say we've made three â€¦
