Ever encountered an `_io.TextIOWrapper` object when you wished you had a string? That's Python's version of a "text file" object!

**Table of contents**

1. [`TextIOWrapper` objects are files](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/TextIOWrapper/#textiowrapper-objects-are-files)

## `TextIOWrapper` objects are files

If you use Python's built-in `open` function to read from a file, you'll end up with a `_io.TextIOWrapper` object. You can think of this as **a file object**.

`>>> file =                                 open("example.txt", mode="rt")                                 >>>                                 type(file)                                 <class                                 '_io.TextIOWrapper'>`
                                

If you open a file in **read mode** (the default mode), you should be able to call the `read` method on your file object to read your file into a string:

`>>> contents = file.read()                                 >>>                                 contents                                 'This is an example text-based file.\nIt                                 existed before we read it.\n'`

## `_io.TextIOWrapper` aren't the _only_ "files"
