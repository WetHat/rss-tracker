In Python, "change" can mean two different things. Assignment changes which object a variable points to. Mutation, changes the object itself.

## Remember: variables are pointers

When talking about Python code, if I say **we changed X**, there are two different things that I might mean.

Let's say we have two variables that point to the same value:

```undefined
>>> a =
                                [2,
                                1, 3,
                                4]
                                >>>
                                b = a
                                
```

Remember that [variables in Python are pointers](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/variables-are-pointers/). That means that **two variables _can point_ to the same object**. That's actually what we've done here.

Let's change the object that the variable `b` points to.

## Mutating a list

If we append a number â€¦
